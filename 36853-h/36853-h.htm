<h1>A VERY NAUGHTY GIRL</h1>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_1'></a>1</span><a name='chI' id='chI'></a>CHAPTER I.—SYLVIA AND AUDREY.</h2>
<p>
It was a day of great excitement, and Audrey Wynford
stood by her schoolroom window and looked
out. She was a tall girl of sixteen, with her hair
hanging in a long, fair plait down her back. She
stood with her hands folded behind her and an expectant
expression on her face.
</p>
<p>
Up the avenue a stream of people were coming.
Some came in cabs, some on bicycles; some walked.
They all turned in the direction of the front entrance,
and Audrey heard their voices rising and falling as
they entered the house, walked down the hall, and
disappeared into some region at the other end.
</p>
<p>
“It is all detestable,” she muttered; “and just
when Evelyn is coming, too. How strange she will
think it! I wish father would drop this horrid custom.
I do not approve of it at all.”
</p>
<p>
Just then her governess, a bright-looking girl
about six years Audrey’s senior, came into the room.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” she cried, “and what are you doing here?
I thought you were going to ride this afternoon.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2'></a>2</span>
</p>
<p>
“How can I?” said Audrey, shrugging her shoulders.
“I shall be met at every turn.”
</p>
<p>
“And why not?” said Miss Sinclair. “You are
not ashamed of being seen.”
</p>
<p>
“It is quite detestable,” said Audrey.
</p>
<p>
She crossed the room, flung herself into a deep
straw armchair in front of a blazing log fire, and
took up a magazine.
</p>
<p>
“It is all horrid,” she continued as she rapidly
turned the pages; “you know it, Miss Sinclair, as
well as I do.”
</p>
<p>
“If I were you,” said Miss Sinclair, “I should be
proud—very proud—to belong to an old family who
had kept a custom like this in vogue.”
</p>
<p>
“If you belonged to the old family you would not,”
said Audrey. “Every one laughs at us. I call it
perfectly horrid. What possible good can it do that
all the people of the neighborhood, and the strangers
who come to stay in the town, should make free of
Wynford Castle on New Year’s Day? It makes me
cross anyhow. I am sorry to be cross to you, Miss
Sinclair; but I am, and that is a fact.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Sinclair sat down on another chair.
</p>
<p>
“I like it,” she said after a pause.
</p>
<p>
“Why?” asked Audrey.
</p>
<p>
“There were some quite hungry people passing
through the hall as I came to you just now.”
</p>
<p>
“Let them be hungry somewhere else, not here,”
said the angry girl. “It was all very well when
some ancestor of mine first started the custom; but
that father, a man of the present day, up-to-date in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3'></a>3</span>
every sense of the word, should carry it on—that he
should keep open house for every individual who
chooses to come here on New Year’s Day—is past
endurance. Last year between two and three hundred
people dined or supped or had tea at the Castle,
and I believe, from the appearance of the avenue,
there will be still more to-day. The house gets so
dirty, for one thing, for half of them don’t think of
wiping their feet; and then we run a chance of being
robbed, for how do we know that there are not
adventurers in the throng? If I were the country-folk
I would be too proud to come; but they are not—not
a bit.”
</p>
<p>
“I cannot agree with you,” said Miss Sinclair.
“It is a splendid old custom, and I hope it will not be
abolished.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps Evelyn will abolish it when she comes in
for the property,” said Audrey in a low tone. Her
face looked scarcely amiable as she said the words.
</p>
<p>
Miss Sinclair regarded her with a puzzled expression.
</p>
<p>
“Audrey dear,” she said after a pause, “I am very
fond of you.”
</p>
<p>
“And I of you,” said Audrey a little unwillingly.
“You are more friend than governess. I should
like best to go to school, of course; but as father
says that that is quite impossible, I have to put up
with the next best; and you are a very good next
best.”
</p>
<p>
“Then if I am, may I just as a friend, and one
who loves you very dearly, make a remark?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span>
</p>
<p>
“It is going to be something odious,” said Audrey—“that
goes without saying—but I suppose I’ll
listen.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you think you are just a wee bit in danger
of becoming selfish, Audrey?” said her governess.
</p>
<p>
“Am I? Perhaps so; I am afraid I don’t
care.”
</p>
<p>
“You would if you thought it over; and this is
New Year’s Day, and it is a lovely afternoon, and
you might come for a ride—I wish you would.”
</p>
<p>
“I will not run the chance of meeting those folks
on any consideration whatever,” said Audrey; “but
I will go for a walk with you, if you like.”
</p>
<p>
“Done,” said Miss Sinclair. “I have to go on a
message for Lady Wynford to the lodge; will you
come by the shrubberies and meet me there?”
</p>
<p>
“All right,” replied Audrey; “I will go and get
ready.”
</p>
<p>
She left the room.
</p>
<p>
After her pupil had left her, Miss Sinclair sat for a
time gazing into the huge log fire.
</p>
<p>
She was a very pretty girl, with a high-bred look
about her. She had received all the advantages
which modern education could afford, and at the age
of three-and-twenty had left Girton with the assurance
from all her friends that she had a brilliant
future before her. The first step in that future
seemed bright enough to the handsome, high-spirited
girl. Lady Wynford met her in town, took a fancy
to her on the spot, and asked her to conduct Audrey’s
education. Miss Sinclair received a liberal salary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>
and every comfort and consideration. Audrey fell
quickly in love with her, and a more delightful pupil
governess never had. The girl was brimming over
with intelligence, was keenly alive to the responsibilities
of her own position, was absolutely original,
and as a rule quite unselfish.
</p>
<p>
“Poor Audrey! she has her trials before her, all
the same,” thought the young governess now.
“Well, I am very happy here, and I hope nothing
will disturb our present arrangement for some time.
As to Evelyn, we have yet to discover what sort of
girl she is. She comes this evening. But there, I
am forgetting all about Audrey, and she must be
waiting for me.”
</p>
<p>
It so happened that Audrey Wynford was doing
nothing of the sort. She had hastily put on her warm
jacket and fur cap and gone out into the grounds.
The objectionable avenue, with its streams of people
coming and going, was to be religiously avoided, and
Audrey went in the direction of a copse of young
trees, which led again through a long shrubbery in
the direction of the lodge gates.
</p>
<p>
It was the custom from time immemorial in the
Wynford family to keep open house on New Year’s
Day. Any wayfarer, gentle or simple, man or
woman, boy or girl, could come up the avenue and
ring the bell at the great front-door, and be received
and fed and refreshed, and sent again on his or her
way with words of cheer. The Squire himself as a
rule received his guests, but where that was impossible
the steward of the estate was present to conduct them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>
to the huge hall which ran across the
back of the house, where unlimited refreshments
were provided. No one was sent away. No one
was refused admission on this day of all days. The
period of the reception was from sunrise to sundown.
At sundown the hospitality came to an end; the
doors of the house were shut and no more visitors
were allowed admission. An extra staff of servants
was generally secured for the occasion, and the one
and only condition made by the Squire was, that as
much food as possible might be eaten, that each male
visitor might drink good wine or sound ale to his
heart’s content, that each might warm himself thoroughly
by the huge log fires, but that no one should
take any food away. This, in the case of so promiscuous
an assemblage, was necessary. To Audrey,
however, the whole thing was more or less a subject
of dislike. She regarded the first day of each year
as a penance; she shrank from the subject of the
guests, and on this special New Year’s Day was more
aggrieved and put out than usual. More guests had
arrived than had ever come before, for the people of
the neighborhood enjoyed the good old custom, and
there was not a villager, not a trades-person, nor
even a landed proprietor near who did not make it a
point of breaking bread at Wynford Castle on New
Year’s Day. The fact that a man of position sat
down side by side with a tramp or a laborer made no
difference; there was no distinction of rank amongst
the Squire’s guests on this day.
</p>
<p>
Audrey heard the voices now as she disappeared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>
into the shelter of the young trees. She heard also
the rumble of wheels as the better class of guests
arrived or went away again.
</p>
<p>
“It is horrid,” she murmured for about the
twentieth time to herself; and then she began to
run in order to get away from what she called the
disagreeable noise.
</p>
<p>
Audrey could run with the speed and grace of a
young fawn, but she had not gone half-through the
shrubbery before she stopped dead-short. A girl of
about her own age was coming hurriedly to meet
her. She was a very pretty girl, with black eyes
and a quantity of black hair and a richly colored
dark face. The girl was dressed somewhat fantastically
in many colors. Peeping out from beneath
her old-fashioned jacket was a scarf of deep yellow;
the skirt of her dress was crimson, and in her hat
she wore two long crimson feathers. Audrey regarded
her with not only wonder but also disfavor.
Who was she? What a vulgar, forward, insufferable
young person!
</p>
<p>
“I say,” cried the girl, coming up eagerly; “I
have lost my way, and it is so important! Can you
tell me how I can get to the front entrance of the
Castle?”
</p>
<p>
“You ought not to have come by the shrubbery,”
said Audrey in a very haughty tone. “The visitors
who come to the Castle to-day are expected to use
the avenue. But now that you have come,” she
added, “if you will take this short cut you will find
yourself in the right direction. You have then but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>
to follow the stream of people and you will reach
the hall door.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, thank you!” said the girl. “I am so awfully
hungry! I do hope I shall get in before sunset.
Good-by, and thank you so much! My name is
Sylvia Leeson; who are you?”
</p>
<p>
“I am Audrey Wynford,” replied Audrey, speaking
more icily than ever.
</p>
<p>
“Then you are the young lady of the Castle?”
</p>
<p>
“I am Audrey Wynford.”
</p>
<p>
“How strange! One would think to meet you
here, and one would think to see me here, that we
both belonged to Shakespeare’s old play <em>As You
Like It</em>. But I must not stay another minute. It
is so sweet of your father to invite us all, and if I
am not quick I shall lose the fun.”
</p>
<p>
She nodded with a flash of bright eyes and white
teeth at the amazed Audrey, and the next moment
was lost to view.
</p>
<p>
“What a girl!” thought Audrey as she pursued
her walk. “How dared she! She did not treat me
with one scrap of respect, and she seemed to think—a
girl of that sort!—that she was my equal; she
absolutely spoke of us in the same breath. It was
almost insulting. Sylvia and Audrey! We meet in
a wood, and we might be characters out of <em>As You
Like It</em>. Well, she is awfully pretty, but—— Oh
dear! what a creature she is when all is said and done—that
wild dress, and those dancing eyes, and that
free manner! And yet—and yet she was scarcely
vulgar; she was only—only different from anybody
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>
else. Who is she, and where does she come from?
Sylvia Leeson. Rather a pretty name; and certainly
a pretty girl. But to think of her partaking
of hospitality—all alone, too—with the <em>canaille</em> of
Wynford!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span><a name='chII' id='chII'></a>CHAPTER II.—ARRIVAL OF EVELYN.</h2>
<p>
Audrey met her governess at the lodge gates,
and the two plunged down a side-path, and were
soon making for the wonderful moors about a mile
away from Wynford Castle.
</p>
<p>
“What are you thinking about, Audrey?” said
Miss Sinclair.
</p>
<p>
“Do you happen to know,” said Audrey, “any
people in the village or neighborhood of the name of
Leeson?”
</p>
<p>
“No, dear, certainly not. I do not think any
people of the name live here. Why do you ask?”
</p>
<p>
“For such a funny reason!” replied Audrey. “I
met a girl who had come by mistake through the
shrubberies. She was on her way to the Castle to
get a good meal. She told me her name was Sylvia
Leeson. She was pretty in an <em>outré</em> sort of style;
she was also very free. She had the cheek to compare
herself with me, and said that as my name was
Audrey and hers Sylvia we ought to be two of
Shakespeare’s heroines. There was something uncommon
about her. Not that I liked her—very far
from that. But I wonder who she is.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” said Miss Sinclair. “I certainly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
have not the least idea that there is any one of that
name living in our neighborhood, but one can never
tell.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, but you know everybody round here,” said
Audrey. “Perhaps she is a stranger. I think on
the whole I am glad.”
</p>
<p>
“I heard a week ago that some people had taken
The Priory,” said Miss Sinclair.
</p>
<p>
“The Priory!” cried Audrey. “It has been uninhabited
ever since I can remember.”
</p>
<p>
“I heard the rumor,” continued Miss Sinclair,
“but I know no particulars, and it may not be
true. It is just possible that this girl belongs to
them.”
</p>
<p>
“I should like to find out,” replied Audrey.
“She certainly interested me although——Oh,
well, don’t let us talk of her any more. Jenny
dear”—Audrey in affectionate moments called her
governess by her Christian name—“are you not
anxious to know what Evelyn is like?”
</p>
<p>
“I suppose I am,” replied Miss Sinclair.
</p>
<p>
“I think of her so much!” continued Audrey.
“It seems so odd that she, a stranger, should be the
heiress, and I, who have lived here all my days,
should inherit nothing. Oh, of course, I shall have
plenty of money, for mother had such a lot; but
it does seem so unaccountable that all father’s property
should go to Evelyn. And now she is to live
here, and of course take the precedence of me, I do
not know that I quite like it. Sometimes I feel that
she will rub me the wrong way; if she is very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
masterful, for instance. She can be—can’t she,
Jenny?”
</p>
<p>
“But why should we suppose that she will be?”
replied Miss Sinclair. “There is no good in getting
prejudiced beforehand.”
</p>
<p>
“I cannot help thinking about it,” said Audrey.
“You know I have never had any close companions
before, and although you make up for everybody
else, and I love you with all my heart and soul, yet
it is somewhat exciting to think of a girl just my
own age coming to live with me.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course, dear; and I am so glad for your
sake!”
</p>
<p>
“But then,” continued Audrey, “she does not
come quite as an ordinary guest; she comes to the
home which is to be hers hereafter. I wonder what
her ideas are, and what she will feel about things.
It is very mysterious. I am excited; I own it.
You may be quite sure, though, that I shall not
show any of my excitement when Evelyn does come.
Jenny, have you pictured her yet to yourself? Do
you think she is tall or short, or pretty or ugly, or
what?”
</p>
<p>
“I have thought of her, of course,” replied Miss
Sinclair; “but I have not formed the least idea.
You will soon know, Audrey; she is to arrive in
time for dinner.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Audrey; “mother is going in the
carriage to meet her, and the train is due at six-thirty.
She will arrive at the Castle a little before
seven. Mother says she will probably bring a maid,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
and perhaps a French governess. Mother does not
know herself what sort she is. It is odd her having
lived away from England all this time.”
</p>
<p>
Audrey chatted on with her governess a little
longer, and presently they turned and went back to
the house. The sun had already set, and the big
front-door was shut; the family never used it except
on this special day or when a wedding or a
funeral left Wynford Castle. The pretty side-door,
with its sheltered porch, was the mode of exit and
ingress for the inhabitants of Wynford Castle. Audrey
and her governess now entered, and Audrey
stood for a few moments to warm her hands by the
huge log fire on the hearth. Miss Sinclair went
slowly up-stairs to her room; and Audrey, finding
herself alone, gave a quick sigh.
</p>
<p>
“I wonder—I do wonder,” she said half-aloud.
</p>
<p>
Her words were evidently heard, for some one
stirred, and presently a tall man with a slight stoop
came forward and stood where the light of the big
fire fell all over him.
</p>
<p>
“Why, dad!” cried Audrey as she put her hand
inside her father’s arm. “Were you asleep?” she
asked. “How was it that Miss Sinclair and I did
not see you when we came in?”
</p>
<p>
“I was sound asleep in that big chair. I was
somewhat tired. I had received three hundred
guests; don’t forget that,” replied Squire Wynford.
</p>
<p>
“And they have gone. What a comfort!” said
Audrey.
</p>
<p>
“My dear little Audrey, I have fed them and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
warmed them and sent them on their way rejoicing,
and I am a more popular Squire Wynford of Castle
Wynford than ever. Why should you grumble because
your neighbors, every mother’s son of them,
had as much to eat and drink as they could desire
on New Year’s Day?”
</p>
<p>
“I hate the custom,” said Audrey. “It belongs
to the Middle Ages; it ought to be exploded.”
</p>
<p>
“What! and allow the people to go hungry?”
</p>
<p>
“Those who are likely to go hungry,” continued
Audrey, “might have money given to them. We do
not want all the small squires everywhere round to
come and feed at the Castle.”
</p>
<p>
“But the small squires like it, and so do the poor
people, and so do I,” said Squire Wynford; and now
he frowned very slightly, and Audrey gave another
sigh.
</p>
<p>
“We must agree to differ, dad,” she said.
</p>
<p>
“I am afraid so, my dear. Well, and how are you,
my pet? I have not seen you until now. Very
happy at the thought of your cousin’s arrival?”
</p>
<p>
“No, dad, scarcely happy, but excited all the same.
Are not you a little, wee bit excited too, father? It
seems so strange her coming all the way from Tasmania
to take possession of her estates. I wonder—I
do wonder—what she will be like.”
</p>
<p>
“She takes possession of no estates while I live,”
said the Squire, “but she is the next heiress.”
</p>
<p>
“And you are sorry it is not I; are you not,
father?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t think of it,” said the Squire. “No,” he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
added thoughtfully a moment later, “that is not the
case. I do think of it. You are better off without
the responsibility; you would never be suited to a
great estate of this sort. Evelyn may be different.
Anyhow, when the time comes it is her appointed
work. Now, my dear”—he took out his watch—“your
cousin will arrive in a moment. Your mother
has gone to meet her. Do you intend to welcome
her here or in one of the sitting-rooms?”
</p>
<p>
“I will stay in the hall, of course,” said Audrey a
little fretfully.
</p>
<p>
“I will leave you, then, my love. I have neglected
a sheaf of correspondence, and would like to look
through my letters before dinner.”
</p>
<p>
The Squire moved away, walking slowly. He
pushed aside some heavy curtains and vanished.
Audrey still stood by the fire. Presently a restless
fit seized her, and she too flitted up the winding white
marble stairs and disappeared down a long corridor.
She entered a pretty room daintily furnished in blue
and silver. A large log fire burned in the grate;
electric light shed its soft gleams over the furniture;
there was a bouquet of flowers and a little pot of ivy
on a small table, also a bookcase full of gaily-bound
story-books. Nothing had been neglected, even to
the big old Bible and the old-fashioned prayer-book.
</p>
<p>
“I wonder how she will like it,” thought Audrey.
“This is one of the prettiest rooms in the house.
Mother said she must have it. I wonder if she will
like it, and if I shall like her. Oh, and here is her
dressing-room, and here is a little boudoir where she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
may sit and amuse herself and shut us out if she
chooses. Lucky Evelyn! How strange it all seems!
For the first time I begin to appreciate my darling,
beloved home. Why should it pass away from me
to her? Oh, of course I am not jealous; I would
not be mean enough to entertain feelings of that sort,
and—— I hear the sound of wheels. She is coming;
in a moment I shall see her. Oh, I do wonder—I do
wonder! I wish Jenny were with me; I feel quite
nervous.”
</p>
<p>
Audrey dashed out of the room, rushed down the
winding stairs, and had just entered the hall when a
footman pushed aside the heavy curtains, and Lady
Frances Wynford, a handsome, stately-looking
woman, entered, accompanied by a small girl.
</p>
<p>
The girl was dragging in a great pile of rugs and
wraps. Her hat was askew on her head, her jacket
untidy. She flung the rugs down in the center of a
rich Turkey carpet; said, “There, that is a relief;”
and then looked full at Audrey.
</p>
<p>
Audrey was a head and shoulders taller than the
heiress, who had thin and somewhat wispy flaxen
hair, and a white face with insignificant features.
Her eyes, however, were steady, brown, large, and
intelligent. She came up to Audrey at once.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t introduce me, please, Aunt Frances,” she
said. “I know this is Audrey.—I am Evelyn. You
hate me, don’t you?”
</p>
<p>
“No, I am sure I do not,” said Audrey.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I should if I were you. It would be much
more interesting to be hated. So this is the place.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
It looks jolly, does it not? Aunt Frances, do you
know where my maid is? I must have her—I must
have her at once. Please tell Jasper to come here,”
continued the girl, turning to a man-servant who
lingered in the background.
</p>
<p>
“Desire Miss Wynford’s maid to come into the
hall,” said Lady Frances in an imperious tone; “and
bring tea, Davis. Be quick.”
</p>
<p>
The man withdrew, and Evelyn, lifting her hand,
took off her ugly felt hat and flung it on the pile of
rugs and cushions.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t touch them, please,” she said as Audrey
advanced. “That is Jasper’s work.—By the way,
Aunt Frances, may Jasper sleep in my room? I
have never slept alone, not since I was born, and I
could not survive it. I want a little bed just the ditto
of my own for Jasper. I cannot live without Jasper.
May she sleep close to me, please, Aunt Frances?
And, oh! I do hope and trust this house is not
haunted. It does look eerie. I am terrified at the
thought of ghosts. I know I shall not be a very
pleasant inmate, and I am sorry for you all—and for
you in special, Audrey. What a grand, keep-your-distance
sort of air you have! But I am not going
to be afraid of you. I do not forget that the place
will belong to me some day. Hullo, Jasper!”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn flitted in a curious, elf-like way across the
hall, and went up to a dark woman who stood just
by the velvet curtain.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t be shy, Jasper,” she said. “You have
nothing to be afraid of here. It is all very grand, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
know; but then it is to be mine some day, and you
are never to leave me—never. I was speaking to my
aunt, Lady Frances, and you are to have your little
bed near mine. See that it is arranged for to-night.
And now, please, pick up these rugs and cushions
and my old hat, and take them to my room. Don’t
stare so, Jasper; do what I tell you.”
</p>
<p>
Jasper somewhat sullenly obeyed. She was as
graceful and deft in all her actions as Evelyn was
the reverse. Evelyn stood and watched her. When
she went slowly up the marble stairs, the heiress
turned with a laugh to her two companions.
</p>
<p>
“How you stare!” she said; and she looked full at
Audrey. “Do you regard me as barbarian, or a
wild beast, or what?”
</p>
<p>
“I am interested in you,” said Audrey in her low
voice. “You are decidedly out of the common.”
</p>
<p>
“Come,” said Lady Frances, “we have no time
for analyzing character just now. Audrey, take
your cousin to her room, and then go yourself and
get dressed for dinner.”
</p>
<p>
“Will you come, Evelyn?” said Audrey.
</p>
<p>
She crossed the hall, Evelyn following her slowly.
Once or twice the heiress stopped to examine a
mailed figure in armor, or an old picture on which
the firelight cast a fitful gleam. She said, “How
ugly! A queer old thing, that!” to the figure in
armor, and she scowled up at the picture.
</p>
<p>
“You are not going to frighten me, you old scarecrow,”
she said; and then she ran up-stairs by
Audrey’s side.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
</p>
<p>
“So this is what they call English grandeur!” she
remarked. “Is not this house centuries old?”
</p>
<p>
“Parts of the house are,” answered Audrey.
</p>
<p>
“Is this part?”
</p>
<p>
“No; the hall and staircase were added about
seventy years ago.”
</p>
<p>
“Is my room in the old part or the new part?”
</p>
<p>
“Your room is in what is called the medium part.
It is a lovely room; you will be charmed with it.”
</p>
<p>
“I by no means know that I shall. But show it
to me.”
</p>
<p>
Audrey walked a little quicker. She began to feel
a curious sense of irritation, and knew that there
was something about Evelyn which might under
certain conditions try her temper very much. They
reached the lovely blue-and-silver room, and Audrey
flung open the door, expecting a cry of delight from
Evelyn. But the heiress was not one to give herself
away; she cast cool and critical eyes round the
chamber.
</p>
<p>
“Dear, dear!” she said—“dear, dear! So this is
your idea of an English bedroom!”
</p>
<p>
“It is an English bedroom; there is no idea about
it,” said Audrey.
</p>
<p>
“You are cross, are you not, Audrey?” was
Evelyn’s remark. “It is very trying for you my coming
here. I know that, of course; Jasper has told me.
I should be ignorant and quite lost were it not for
Jasper, but Jasper puts me up to things. I do not
think I could live without her. She has often described
you—often and often. It would make you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
scream to listen to her. She has taken you off
splendidly. Really, all things considered, you are
very like what she has pictured you. I say, Audrey,
would you like to come up here after your next meal,
whatever you call it, and watch Jasper as she takes
you off? She is the most splendid mimic in all the
world. In a day or two she will be able to imitate
Aunt Frances and every one in the house. Oh, it is
killing to watch her and to listen to her! You
would like to see yourself through Jasper’s eyes,
would you not, Audrey?”
</p>
<p>
“No, thank you,” replied Audrey.
</p>
<p>
“How you kill me with that ‘No, thank you,’ of
yours! Why, they are the very words Jasper said
you would be certain to say. Oh dear! this is quite
amusing.” Evelyn laughed long and loud, wiping
her eyes with her handkerchief as she did so. “Oh
dear! oh dear!” she said. “Don’t look any crosser,
Audrey, or I shall die with laughing! Why, you
will make me scream.”
</p>
<p>
“That would be bad for you after your journey,”
said Audrey. “I see you have hot water, and your
maid is in the dressing-room. I will leave you now.
That is the dressing-bell; the bell for dinner will ring
in half an hour. I must go and dress.”
</p>
<p>
Audrey rushed out of the room, very nearly, but
not quite, banging the door after her.
</p>
<p>
“If I stayed another moment I should lose my
temper. I should say something terrible,” thought
the girl. Her heart was beating fast; she pressed
her hand to her side. “If it were not for Jenny
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
I do not believe I could endure the house with that
girl,” was her next ejaculation. “To think that
she is a Wynford, and that the Castle—the lovely,
beautiful Castle—is to belong to her some day. Oh,
it is maddening! Our darling knight in armor—Sir
Galahad I have always called him—and our
Rembrandt: one is a scarecrow, and the other a
queer old thing. Oh Evelyn, you are almost past
bearing!”
</p>
<p>
Audrey ran away to her room, where her maid,
Eleanor, was waiting to attend on her. Audrey was
never in the habit of confiding in her maid; and the
girl, who was brimful of importance, curiosity, and
news, did not dare to express any of her feelings to
Miss Audrey in her present mood.
</p>
<p>
“Put on my very prettiest frock to-night, please,
Eleanor,” said the young lady. “Dress my hair to
the best advantage. My white dress, did you say?
No, not white, but that pale, very pale, rose-colored
silk with all the little trimmings and flounces.”
</p>
<p>
“But that is one of your gayest dresses, Miss
Audrey.”
</p>
<p>
“Never mind; I choose to look gay and well
dressed.”
</p>
<p>
The girl proceeded with her young mistress’s toilet,
and a minute or two before the second bell rang
Audrey was ready. She made a lovely and graceful
picture as she looked at herself for a moment in
the long mirror. Her figure was already beautifully
formed; she was tall, graceful, dignified. The set
of her young head on her stately neck was superb.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
Her white shoulders gleamed under the transparent
folds of her lovely frock. Her rounded arms were
white as alabaster. She slipped a small diamond
ring on one of her fingers, looked for a moment longingly
at a pearl necklace, but finally decided not to
wear any more adornment, and ran lightly down-stairs.
</p>
<p>
The big drawing-room was lit with the softest
light. The Squire stood by the hearth, on which a
huge log blazed. Lady Frances, in full evening-dress,
was carelessly turning the leaves of a novel.
</p>
<p>
“What a quiet evening we are likely to have!”
she said, looking up at the Squire as she spoke.
“To-morrow there are numbers of guests coming;
we shall be a big party, and Audrey and Evelyn will,
I trust, have a pleasant time.—My dear Audrey, why
that dress this evening?”
</p>
<p>
“I took a fancy to wear it, mother,” said Audrey
in a light tone.
</p>
<p>
There was more color than usual in her cheeks,
and her eyes were brighter than her mother had
ever seen them. Lady Frances was not a woman
of any special discernment. She was an excellent
mother and a splendid hostess. She was good to
look at, and was just the sort of <em>grande dame</em> to keep
up all the dignity of Wynford Castle, but she never
even pretended to understand her only child. The
Squire, a sensitive man in many ways, was also more
or less a stranger to Audrey’s real character. He
looked at her, it is true, a little anxiously now, and
a slight curiosity stirred his breast as to the possible
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
effect Evelyn’s presence in the house might have on
his beautiful young daughter. As to Evelyn herself,
he had not seen her, and did not even care to inquire
of his wife what sort of girl she was. He was
deeply absorbed over the silver currency question,
and was writing an exhaustive paper on it for the
<em>Nineteenth Century</em>; he had not time, therefore,
to worry about domestic matters. Just then the
drawing-room door was flung open, and the footman
announced, as though she were a stranger:
</p>
<p>
“Miss Evelyn Wynford.”
</p>
<p>
If Audrey was, according to Lady Frances’s ideas,
slightly overdressed for so small a party, she was
quite outshone by Evelyn, whose dress was altogether
unsuitable for her age. She wore a very thick silk,
bright blue in color, with a quantity of colored embroidery
thrown over it. Her little fat neck was
bare, and her sleeves were short. Her scanty fair
hair was arranged on the top of her head, two diamond
pins supporting it in position; a diamond
necklace was clasped round her neck, and she had
bracelets on her arms. She was evidently intensely
pleased with herself, and looked with the utmost
confidence from Lady Frances to her uncle. With
a couple of long strides the Squire advanced to meet
her. He looked into her queer little face and all his
indifference vanished. She was his only brother’s
only child. He had loved his brother better than
any one on earth, and, come what might, he would
give that brother’s child a welcome. So he took
both of Evelyn’s tiny hands, and suddenly stooping,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
he lifted her an inch or so from the ground and
kissed her twice. Something in his manner made
the little girl give a sort of gasp.
</p>
<p>
“Why, it is just as if you were father come to
life,” she said. “I am glad to see you, Uncle Ned.”
</p>
<p>
Still holding her hand, the Squire walked up to
the hearth and stood there facing Audrey and his
wife.
</p>
<p>
“You have been introduced to Audrey, have you
not, Evelyn?” he said.
</p>
<p>
“I did not need to be introduced. I saw a girl
in the hall, and I guessed it must be Audrey. ’Cute
of me, was it not? Do you know, Uncle Ned, I
don’t much like this place, but I like you. Yes, I
am right-down smitten with you, but I don’t think
I like anything else. You don’t mind if I am frank,
Uncle Ned; it always was my way. We are
brought up like that in Tasmania—Audrey, don’t
frown at me; you don’t look pretty when you frown.
But, oh! I say, the bell has gone, has it not?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, my dear,” said Lady Frances.
</p>
<p>
“And it means dinner, does it not?”
</p>
<p>
“Certainly, Evelyn,” said her uncle, bending towards
her with the most polished and stately grace.
“Allow me, my niece, to conduct you to the dining-room.”
</p>
<p>
“How droll you are, uncle!” said Evelyn. “But
I like you all the same. You are a right-down good
old sort. I am awfully peckish; I shall be glad of a

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span><a name='chIII' id='chIII'></a>CHAPTER III.—THE CRADLE LIFE OF WILD EVE.</h2>
<p>
Eighteen years before the date of this story, two
brothers had parted with angry words. They were
both in love with the same woman, and the younger
brother had won. The elder brother, only one year
his senior, could not stand defeat.
</p>
<p>
“I cannot stay in the old place,” he said. “You
can occupy the Castle during my absence.”
</p>
<p>
To this arrangement Edward Wynford agreed.
</p>
<p>
“Where are you going?” he said to his brother
Frank.
</p>
<p>
“To the other side of the world—Australia probably.
I don’t know when I shall return. It does
not much matter. I shall never marry. The estate
will be yours. If Lady Frances has a son, it will
belong to him.”
</p>
<p>
“You must not think of that,” said Edward. “I
will live at the Castle for a few years in order to
keep it warm for you, but you will come back; you
will get over this. If she had loved you, old man, do
you think I would have taken her from you? But
she chose me from the very first.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t blame you, Ned,” said Frank. “You are
as innocent of any intention of harm to me as the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
unborn babe, but I love her too well to stay in the
old country. I am off. I don’t want her ever to
know. You will promise me, won’t you, that you
will never tell her why I have skulked off and
dropped my responsibilities on to your shoulders?
Promise me that, at least, will you not?”
</p>
<p>
Edward Wynford promised his brother, and the
brother went away.
</p>
<p>
In the former generation father and son had agreed
to break off the entail, and although there was no
intention of carrying this action into effect, and
Frank, as eldest son, inherited the great estates of
Wynford Castle, yet at his father’s death he was in
the position of one who could leave the estates to
any one he pleased.
</p>
<p>
During his last interview with his brother he said
to him distinctly:
</p>
<p>
“Remember, if Lady Frances has a son I wish
him to be, after yourself, the next heir to the property.”
</p>
<p>
“But if she has not a son?” said Edward.
</p>
<p>
“In that case I have nothing to say. It is most
unlikely that I shall marry. The property will come
to you in the ordinary way, and as the entail is out
off, you can leave it to whom you please.”
</p>
<p>
“Do not forget that at present you can leave the
estate and the Castle to whomever you please, even
to an utter stranger,” said Edward, with a slight
smile.
</p>
<p>
To this remark Frank made no answer. The next
day the brothers parted—as it turned out, for life.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
Edward married Lady Frances, and they went to
live at Wynford Castle. Edward heard once from
Frank during the voyage, and then not at all, until
he received a letter which must have been written a
couple of months before his brother’s death. It was
forwarded to him in a strange hand, and was full of
extraordinary and painful tidings. Frank Wynford
had died suddenly of acute fever, but before his
death he had arranged all his affairs. His letter
ran as follows:
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
“<span class='sc'>My dear Edward</span>,—If I live you will never get
this letter; if I die it reaches you all in good time.
When last we parted I told you I should never
marry. So much for man’s proposals. When I got
to Tasmania I went on a ranch, and now I am the husband
of the farmer’s daughter. Her name is Isabel.
She is a handsome woman, and the mother of a daughter.
Why I married her I can not tell you, except that
I can honestly say it was not with any sense of affection.
But she is my wife, and the mother of a little
baby girl. Edward, when I last heard from you,
you told me that you also had a daughter. If a son
follows all in due course, what I have to say will
not much signify; but if you have no son I should
wish the estates eventually to come to my little girl.
I do not believe in a woman’s administration of
large and important estates like mine, but what I
say to myself now is, as well my girl as your girl.
Therefore, Edward, my dear brother, I leave all my
estates to you for your lifetime, and at your death all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
the property which came to me by my father’s will
goes to my little girl, to be hers when you are no
longer there. I want you to receive my daughter,
and to ask your wife to bring her up. I want her
to have all the advantages that a home with Lady
Frances must confer on her. I want my child and
your child to be friends. I do no injustice to your
daughter, Edward, when I make my will, for she
inherits money on her mother’s side. I will acquaint
my wife with particulars of this letter, and in case
I catch the fever which is raging here now she will
know how to act. My lawyer in Hobart Town will
forward this, and see that my will is carried into
effect. There is a provision in it for the maintenance
of my daughter until she joins you at Castle Wynford.
Whenever that event takes place she is your
care. I have only one thing to add. The child
might go to you at once (I have a premonition that I
am about to die very soon), and thus never know
that she had an Australian mother, but the difficulty
lies in the fact that the mother loves the child and
will scarcely be induced to part with her. You
must not receive my poor wife unless indeed a radical
change takes place in her; and although I have
begged of her to give up the child, I doubt if she
will do it. I cannot add any more, for time presses.
My will is legal in every respect, and there will be
no difficulty in carrying it into effect.”
</p>
<p>
This strange letter was discovered by Frank
Wynford’s widow a month after his death. It was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
sealed and directed to his brother in England. She
longed to read it, but restrained herself. She sent
it on to her husband’s lawyer in Hobart Town, and
in due course it arrived at Castle Wynford, causing
a great deal of consternation and distress both in
the minds of the Squire and Lady Frances.
</p>
<p>
Edward immediately went out to Tasmania. He
saw the little baby who was all that was left of his
brother, and he also saw that brother’s wife. The
coarse, loud-voiced woman received him with almost
abuse. What was to be done? The mother refused
to part with the child, and Edward Wynford, for
his own wife’s sake and his own baby daughter’s
sake, could not urge her to come to Castle Wynford.
</p>
<p>
“I do not care twopence,” she remarked, “whether
the child has grand relations or not. I loved her
father, and I love her. She is my child, and so she
has got to put up with me. As long as I live she
stays with me here. I am accustomed to ranch life,
and she will get accustomed to it too. I will not
spare money on her, for there is plenty, and she will
be a very rich woman some day. But while I live
she stays with me; the only way out of it is, that
you ask me to your fine place in England. Even if
you do, I don’t think I should be bothered to go to
you, but you might have the civility to ask me.”
</p>
<p>
Squire Wynford went away, however, without
giving this invitation. He spoke to his wife on the
subject. In that conversation he was careful to adhere
to his brother’s wish not to reveal to her that
that brother’s deep affection for herself had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
the cause of his banishment. Lady Frances was an
intensely just and upright woman. She had gone
through a very bad quarter of an hour when she
was told that her little girl was to be supplanted by
the strange child of an objectionable mother, but
she quickly recovered herself.
</p>
<p>
“I will not allow jealousy to enter into my life,”
she said; and she even went the length of writing
herself to Mrs. Wynford in Tasmania, and invited
her with the baby to come and stay at Wynford
Castle. Mrs. Wynford in Tasmania, however, much
to the relief of the good folks at home, declined the
invitation.
</p>
<p>
“I have no taste for English grandeur,” she said.
“I was brought up in a wild state, and I would
rather stay as I was reared. The child is well; you
can have her when she is grown up or when I am
dead.”
</p>
<p>
Years passed after this letter and there was no
communication between little Evelyn Wynford, in
the wilds of Tasmania, and her rich and stately relatives
at Castle Wynford. Lady Frances fervently
hoped that God would give her a son, but this hope
was not to be realized. Audrey was her only child,
and soon it seemed almost like a dim, forgotten fact
that the real heiress was in Tasmania, and that
Audrey had no more to do in the future with the
stately home of her ancestors than she would have
had had she possessed a brother. But when she was
sixteen there suddenly came a change. Mrs. Wynford
died suddenly. There was now no reason why
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
Evelyn should not come home, and accordingly, untutored,
uncared for, a passionate child with a curious,
wilful strain in her, she arrived on New Year’s Day
at Castle Wynford.
</p>
<p>
Evelyn Wynford’s nature was very complex. She
loved very few people, but those she did love she
loved forever. No change, no absence, no circumstances
could alter her regard. In her ranch life
and during her baby days she had clung to her
mother. Mrs. Wynford was fierce and passionate
and wilful. Little Evelyn admired her, whatever
she did. She trotted round the farm after her; she
learnt to ride almost as soon as she could walk, and
she followed her mother barebacked on the wildest
horses on the ranch. She was fearless and stubborn,
and gave way to terrible fits of passion, but with
her mother she was gentle as a lamb. Mrs. Wynford
was fond of the child in the careless, selfish, and yet
fierce way which belonged to her nature. Mrs.
Wynford’s sole idea of affection was that her child
should be with her morning, noon, and night; that
for no education, for no advantages, should she be
parted from her mother for a moment. Night after
night the two slept in each other’s arms; day after
day they were together. The farmer’s daughter
was a very strong woman, and as her father died a
year or two after her husband, she managed the
ranch herself, keeping everything in order, and not
allowing the slightest insubordination on the part of
her servants. Little Evelyn, too, learnt her mother’s
masterful ways. She could reprimand; she could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
insist upon obedience; she could shake her tiny fists
in the faces of those who dared to oppose her; and
when she was disporting herself so Mrs. Wynford
stood by and laughed.
</p>
<p>
“Hullo!” she used to cry. “See the spirit in the
young un. She takes after me. A nice time her
English relatives will have with her! But she will
never go to them—never while I live.”
</p>
<p>
Although Mrs. Wynford had long ago made up
her mind that Evelyn was to have none of the immediate
advantages of her birth and future prospects,
she was fond of talking to the child about
the grandeur which lay before her.
</p>
<p>
“If I die, Eve,” she said, “you will have to go
across the sea in a big ship to England. You would
have a rough time of it, perhaps, on board, but you
won’t mind that, my beauty.”
</p>
<p>
“I am not a beauty, mother,” answered Evelyn.
“You know I am not. You know I am a very
plain girl.”
</p>
<p>
“Hark to the child!” shrieked Mrs. Wynford.
“It is as good as a play to hear her. If you are not
beautiful in body, my darling, you are beautiful in
your spirit. Yes, you have inherited from your
proud English father lots of gold and a lovely castle,
and all your relations will have to eat humble-pie to
you; but you have got your spirit from me, Eve—don’t
forget that.”
</p>
<p>
“Tell me about the Castle, mother, and about my
father,” said Evelyn, nestling up close to her parent,
as they sat by the roaring fire in the winter evenings.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Wynford knew very little, and what she
did know she exaggerated. She gave Evelyn vivid
pictures, however, in each and all of which the principal
figure was Evelyn herself—Evelyn claiming
her rights, mastering her relations, letting her unknown
cousin know that she, Evelyn, was the heiress,
and that the cousin was nobody. Only one person
in the group of Evelyn’s future relations did Mrs.
Wynford counsel her to be civil to.
</p>
<p>
“The worst of it all is this, Eve,” she said—“while
your uncle lives you do not own a pennypiece
of the estate; and he may hold out for many
a long day, so you had best be agreeable to him.
Besides, he is like your father. Your father was a
very handsome man and a very fine man, and I loved
him, child. I took a fancy to him from the day he
arrived at the ranch, and when he asked me to marry
him I thought myself in rare good luck. But he
died soon after you were born. Had he lived I’d
have been the lady of the Castle, but I’d not go
there without him, and you shall never go while I
live.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t want to, mother. You are more to me
than twenty castles,” said the enthusiastic little girl.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Wynford had one friend whom Evelyn tolerated
and presently loved. That friend was a
woman, partly of French extraction, who had come
to stay at the ranch once during a severe illness of
its owner. Her name was Jasper—Amelia Jasper;
but she was known on the ranch by the title of
Jasper alone. She was not a lady in any sense of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>
the word, and did not pretend that she was one;
but she was possessed of a certain strange fascination
which she could exercise at will over those with
whom she came in contact, and she made herself so
useful to Mrs. Wynford and so necessary to Evelyn
that she was never allowed to leave the ranch again.
She soon obtained a great power over the curious,
uneducated woman who was Evelyn’s mother; and
when at last Mrs. Wynford found that she was
smitten with an incurable disease, and that at any
moment death would come to fetch her, she asked
her dear friend Jasper to take the child to England.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll tell you what I’ll do,” said Jasper. “I’ll
take Evelyn to England, and stay with her there.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Wynford laughed.
</p>
<p>
“You are clever enough, Jasper,” she said; “but
what a figure of fun you would look in the grand
sort of imperial residence that my dear late husband
has described to me! You are not a lady, you
know, although you are smart and clever enough to
beat half the ladies out of existence.”
</p>
<p>
“I shall know how to manage,” said Jasper. “I,
too, have heard of the ways of English grandees.
I’ll be Evelyn’s maid. She cannot do without a
maid, can she? I’ll take Evelyn back, and I will
stay with her as her maid.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Wynford hailed this idea as a splendid one,
and she even wrote a very badly spelt letter to Lady
Frances, which Jasper was to convey and deliver
herself, if possible, to her proud ladyship, as the
widow called her sister-in-law. In this letter Mrs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
Wynford demanded that Jasper was to stay with
Evelyn as long as Evelyn wished for her, and she
finally added:
</p>
<p>
“I dare you, Lady Frances, fine lady as you are,
to part the child from her maid.”
</p>
<p>
When Mrs. Wynford died Evelyn gave way to the
most terrible grief. She refused to eat; she refused
to leave her mother’s dead body. She shrieked herself
into hysterics on the day of the funeral, and
then the poor little girl was prostrated with nervous
fever. Finally, she became so unwell that it was
impossible for her to travel to England for some
months. And so it happened that nearly a year
elapsed between the death of the mother and the
arrival of the child at Castle Wynford.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span><a name='chIV' id='chIV'></a>CHAPTER IV.—“I DRAW THE LINE AT UNCLE NED.”</h2>
<p>
“Well, Jasper,” said Evelyn in a very eager voice
to her maid that first night, “and how do you like
it all?”
</p>
<p>
“How do you like it, Evelyn?” was the response.
</p>
<p>
“That is so like you, Jasper!” replied the spoilt
little girl. “When all is said and done, you are not
a scrap original. You make me like you—I cannot
help myself—but in some ways you are too
cautious to please me. You don’t want to say what
you think of the place until you know my opinion.
Well, I don’t care; I’ll tell you out plump what I
think of everything. The place is horrid, and so
are the people. I wish—oh! I wish I was back
again on the ranch with mother.”
</p>
<p>
Jasper looked down rather scornfully at the small
girl, who, in a rich and elaborately embroidered
dressing-gown, was kneeling by the fire. Evelyn’s
handsome eyes, the only really good feature she
possessed, were fixed full upon her maid’s face.
</p>
<p>
“The Castle is too stiff for me,” she said, “and
too—too airified and high and mighty. Mother was
quite right when she spoke of Castle Wynford. I
don’t care for anybody in the place except Uncle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
Ned. I don’t know how I shall live here. Oh Jasper,
don’t you remember the evenings at home?
Cannot you recall that night when Whitefoot was
ill, and you and mothery and I had to sit up all
through the long hours nursing her, and how we
thought the dear old moo-cow would die! Don’t
you remember the mulled cider and the gingerbread
and the doughnuts and the apple-rings? How we
toasted the apple-rings by the fire, and how they
spluttered, and how good the hot cider was? And
don’t you remember how mothery sang, and how
you and I caught each other’s hands and danced,
and dear old Whitefoot looked up at us with her
big, sorrowful eyes? It is true that she died in the
morning, but we had a jolly night. We’ll never
have such times any more. Oh, I do wish my own
mothery had not died and gone to heaven! Oh, I
do wish it—I do!”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn crossed her arms tightly on her breast
and began to sway herself backwards and forwards.
Tears streamed from her eyes; she did not attempt
to wipe them away.
</p>
<p>
“Now then, it is my turn to speak,” said Jasper.
“I tell you what it is, Eve; you are about the biggest
goose that was ever born in this world. Who
would compare that stupid, rough old ranch with
this lovely, magnificent house? And it is your own,
Eve—or rather it will be your own. I took a good
stare at the Squire, and I do not believe he will live
to be very old; and whenever he dies you are to
take possession—you and I together, Eve love—and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
out will go her ladyship, and out will go proud Miss
Audrey. That will be a fine day, darling—a day
worth living for.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Evelyn slowly; “and then we’ll alter
things. We’ll make the Castle something like the
ranch. We’ll get over some of our friends, and
they shall live in the house. Mr. and Mrs. Petrie,
who keep the egg-farm not a mile from the ranch,
and Mr. Thomas Longchamp and Pete and Dick
and Tom and Michael. I told them all when I was
going away that when I was mistress of the Castle
they should come, and we’ll go on much as we went
on at the ranch. If mothery up in heaven can see
me she will be glad. But, Jasper, why do you speak
in that scornful way of my cousin Audrey? I think
she is very beautiful. I think she is quite the most
beautiful girl I have ever looked at. As to her
being stately, she cannot help being stately. I wish
I could walk like her, and talk like her, and speak
like her; I do, Jasper—I do really.”
</p>
<p>
“Let me see,” said Jasper in a contemplative tone.
“You are learning to love her, ain’t you?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t love easily. I love my own darling
mothery, who is not dead at all, for she is in heaven
with father; and I love you, Jasper, and my uncle
Edward.”
</p>
<p>
“My word! and why him?”
</p>
<p>
“I cannot help it; I love him already, and I’ll
love him more and more the longer I see him and
the more I know him. My father must have been
like that—a gentleman—a perfect gentleman. Oh!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
I was happy at the ranch, and mothery was like no
one else on the wide earth, but it gave me a sort of
quiver down my spine when Uncle Edward took
my hand, and when he kissed me. He is like what
father was. Had father lived I’d have spent all my
days here, and I’d have been perhaps quite as graceful
as Audrey, and nearly as beautiful.”
</p>
<p>
“You will never be like her, so you need not
think it. You are squat like your mother, and you
ain’t got a decent feature in your face except your
eyes, and even they are only big, not dark; and
your hair is skimpy and your face white. You are
a sort of mix’um-gather’um—a sort of betwixt-and-between—neither
very fair nor very dark, neither
very short nor very tall. You are thick-set, just
the very image of your mother, and you will always
be thick-set and always mix’um-gather’um as long
as you live. There! I have spoken. I ain’t going
to be afraid of you. You had better get into bed
now, for it is late. You want your beauty-sleep,
and you won’t get it unless you are quick. Now
march! Put on your night-dress and step into
bed.”
</p>
<p>
“I have got to say my prayers first,” said Evelyn,
“and——” She paused and looked full at her
maid. “I have got to say something else. If you
talk like that I won’t love you any more. You are
not to do it. I won’t have it.”
</p>
<p>
“Won’t she, then?” said Jasper. Her whole
manner changed. “And have I hurt her—have I—the
little dear? Come to me, my darling. Why,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>
you are all trembling! Did you think I meant a
word I said? Don’t you know that you are the
jewel of my eyes and the core of my heart and all
the rest? Did your mother leave you to me for
nothing, and would I ever leave you, sweetest and
best? And if it is squat you are, there is no one
like you for determination and fire of spirit. Eh,
now, come to my arms and I’ll rock the bitterness
out of you, for it is puzzled you are, and fretted you
are, and you shall not be—no, you shall not be either
one or the other ever again while old Jasper lives.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn’s eyes, which had flashed an almost ugly
fire, now softened. She looked at Jasper as if she
meant to resist her. Then she wavered, and came
almost totteringly across the room, and the next
moment the strange woman had clasped the girl to
her embrace and was rocking her backwards and
forwards, Evelyn’s head lying on her breast just as
if she were a baby.
</p>
<p>
“Now then, that’s better,” said Jasper. “I’ll
undress you as though we were back again on the
ranch, and when you are snug and safe in your little
white bed we’ll have a bit of fun.”
</p>
<p>
“Fun!” said Evelyn. “What?”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you know how you like a stolen supper?
I have got chocolate here, and a little pot, and a jug
of cream, and a saucepan, and I’ll make a rich cup
for you and another for myself; and here’s a box
of cakes, all sorts and very good. While you are
sipping your chocolate I’ll take off Miss Audrey and
Lady Frances for you. The door is locked; no one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
can see us. We’ll be as snug as snug can be, and
we’ll have our fun just as if we were back at the
ranch.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn was now all laughter and high spirits.
She had no idea of restraining herself. She called
Jasper her honey and her honey-pot, and kissed the
good woman several times. She superintended the
making of the chocolate with eager words and many
directions. Finally, a cup of the rich beverage was
handed to her, and she sipped it, luxuriously curled
up against her snowy pillows, and ate the sweet
cakes, and watched Jasper with happy eyes.
</p>
<p>
“So it is Miss Audrey you’d like to take after?”
said Jasper. “You think you are not a patch on
her. To be sure not—wait and we’ll see.”
</p>
<p>
In an instant Jasper had transformed her features
to a comical resemblance of Audrey’s. She spoke
in mincing tones, with just sufficient likeness to
Audrey to cause Evelyn to scream with mirth. She
took light, quick steps across the room, and imitated
Audrey’s very words. All of a sudden she changed
her manner. She now resembled Miss Sinclair,
putting on the slightly precise language of the governess,
adjusting her shoulders and arranging her
hands as she had seen Miss Sinclair do for a brief
moment that evening. Her personation of Miss Sinclair
was as good as her personation of Audrey, and
Evelyn became so excited that she very nearly spilt
her chocolate. But her crowning delight came when
all of a sudden, without the slightest warning, Jasper
became Lady Frances herself. She now sailed rather
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
than walked across the apartment; her tones were
stately and slow; her manner was the sort which
might inspire awe; her very words were those of
Lady Frances. But the delighted maid believed
that she had a further triumph in store, for, with a
quick change of mien, she now had the audacity to
personate the Squire himself; but in one instant,
like a flash, Evelyn was out of bed. She put down
her chocolate-cup and rushed towards Jasper.
</p>
<p>
“The others as much as you like,” she said, “but
not Uncle Ned. You dare not. You sha’n’t. I’ll
turn you away if you do. I’ll hate you if you do.
The others over and over again—they are lovely,
splendid, grand—it puts heart in me to see you—but
not Uncle Ned.”
</p>
<p>
Jasper looked in astonishment at the little girl.
</p>
<p>
“So you love him as much as that already?” she
said. “Well, as you please, of course.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t be cross, Jasper,” said Evelyn. “I can
stand all the others; I can even like them. I told
Audrey to-night how splendidly you can mimic, and
you shall mimic her to her face when I know her
better. Oh, it is killing—it is killing! But I draw
the line at Uncle Ned.”
</p>

<p>
Evelyn did not get up to breakfast the following
morning. Breakfast at the Castle was a rather
stately affair. A loud, musical gong sounded to
assemble the family at a quarter to nine; then all
those who were not really ill were expected to appear
in the small chapel, where the Squire read
prayers morning after morning before the assembled
household. After prayers, visitors and family alike
trooped into the comfortable breakfast-room, where
a merry and hearty meal ensued. To be absent
from breakfast was to insure Lady Frances’s displeasure;
she had no patience with lazy people. And
as to lazy girls, her horror of them was so great that
Audrey would rather bear the worst cold possible
than announce to her mother that she was too ill
to appear. Evelyn’s absence, therefore, was commented
on with a very grave expression of face by
both the Squire and his wife.
</p>
<p>
“I must speak to her,” said Lady Frances. “It
is the first morning, and she does not understand
our ways, but it must not occur again.”
</p>
<p>
“You will not be too hard on the child, dear,”
said her husband. “Remember she has never had
the advantage of your training.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
</p>
<p>
“Poor little creature!” said Lady Frances.
“That, indeed, my dear Edward, is plain to be
seen.”
</p>
<p>
She bridled very slightly. Lady Frances knew
that there was not a more correct trainer of youth
in the length and breadth of the county than herself.
Audrey, who looked very bright and handsome
that morning, ventured to glance at her mother.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps Evelyn is dressed and does not know
that we are at breakfast,” she said. “May I go to
her room and find out?”
</p>
<p>
“No, Audrey, not this morning. I shall go to see
Evelyn presently. By the way, I hope you are ready
for your visitors?”
</p>
<p>
“I suppose so, mother. I don’t really quite know
who are coming.”
</p>
<p>
“The Jervices, of course—Henrietta, Juliet, and
their brothers; there are also the Claverings, Mary
and Sophie. I think those are the only young people,
but with six in addition to you and Evelyn, you will
have your hands full, Audrey.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I don’t mind,” replied Audrey. “It will be
fun.—You will help me all you can, won’t you,
Jenny?”
</p>
<p>
“Certainly, dear,” replied Miss Sinclair.
</p>
<p>
“It is the greatest possible comfort to me to have
you in the house, Miss Sinclair,” said Lady Frances,
now turning to the pretty young governess. “You
have not yet had an interview with Evelyn, have
you?”
</p>
<p>
“I talked to her a little last night,” replied Miss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
Sinclair. “She seems to me to be a child with a
good deal of character.”
</p>
<p>
“She is like no child I ever met before,” said Lady
Frances, with a shudder. “I must frankly say I
never looked forward with any pleasure to her arrival,
but my worst fears did not picture so thoroughly
objectionable a little girl.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, come, Frances—come!” said her husband.
</p>
<p>
“My dear Edward, I do not give myself away as
a rule; but it is just as well that Miss Sinclair should
see how much depends on her guidance of the poor
little girl, and that Audrey should know how objectionable
she is, and how necessary it is for us all to
do what we can to alter her ways. The first step,
of course, is to get rid of that terrible woman whom
she calls Jasper.”
</p>
<p>
“But, mother,” said Audrey, “that would hurt
Evelyn’s feelings very much—she is so devoted to
Jasper.”
</p>
<p>
“You must leave the matter to me, Audrey,” said
Lady Frances, rising. “You may be sure that I
will do nothing really cruel or unkind. But, my
dear, it is as well that you should learn sooner or
later that spoiling a person is never true kindness.”
</p>
<p>
Lady Frances left the room as she spoke; and
Audrey, turning to her governess, said a few words
to her, and they also went slowly in the direction
of the conservatory.
</p>
<p>
“What do you think of her, Jenny?” asked the
girl.
</p>
<p>
“Just what I said, dear. The child is full of originality
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
and strong feelings, but of course, brought
up as she has been, she will be a trial to your
mother.”
</p>
<p>
“That is just it. Mother has never seen any one
in the least like Evelyn. She won’t understand her;
and if she does not there will be mischief.”
</p>
<p>
“Evelyn must learn to subdue her will to that of
Lady Frances,” said Miss Sinclair. “You and I,
Audrey, will try to be very patient with her; we
will put up with her small impertinences, knowing
that she scarcely means them; and we will try to
make things as happy for her as we can.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know about that,” said Audrey. “I
cannot see why she should be rude and chuff and
disagreeable. I don’t altogether dislike her. She
certainly amuses me. But she will not have a very
happy time at the Castle until she knows her place.”
</p>
<p>
“That is it,” said Miss Sinclair. “She has evidently
been spoken to most injudiciously—told that
she is practically mistress of the place, and that she
may do as she likes here. Hence the result. But
at the worst, Audrey, I am certain of one thing.”
</p>
<p>
“What is that, Jenny? How wise you look, and
how kind!”
</p>
<p>
“I believe your father will be able to manage her,
whoever else fails. Did you not notice how her eyes
followed him round the room last night, and how,
whenever he spoke to her, her voice softened and
she always replied in a gentle tone?”
</p>
<p>
“No, I did not,” answered Audrey. “Oh dear!
it is very puzzling, and I feel rather cross myself. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
cannot imagine why that horrid little girl should
ever own this lovely place. It is not that I am
jealous of her—I assure you I am anything but that—but
it hurts me to think that one who can appreciate
things so little should come in for our lovely
property.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, darling, let us hope she will be quite a
middle-aged woman before she possesses Castle
Wynford,” said the governess. “And now, what
about your young friends?”
</p>
<p>
Audrey slipped her hand inside Miss Sinclair’s
arm, and the two paced the conservatory, talking
long and earnestly.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Evelyn, having partaken of a rich and
unwholesome breakfast of pastry, game-pie, and chocolate,
condescended slowly to rise. Jasper waited
on her hand and foot. A large fire burned in the
grate; no servant had been allowed into the apartment
since Evelyn had taken possession of it the
night before, and it already presented an untidy
and run-to-seed appearance. White ashes were piled
high in the untidy grate; dust had collected on the
polished steel of the fire-irons; dust had also mounted
to the white marble mantelpiece covered with velvet
of turquoise-blue, but neither Evelyn nor Jasper
minded these things in the least.
</p>
<p>
“And now, pet,” said the maid, “what dress will
you wear?”
</p>
<p>
“I had better assert myself as soon as possible,”
said Evelyn. “Mothery told me I must. So I had
better put on something striking. I saw that horrid
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
Audrey walking past just now with her governess;
she had on a plain, dark-blue serge. Why, any
dairymaid might dress like that. Don’t you agree
with me, Jasper?”
</p>
<p>
“There is your crimson velvet,” said Jasper. “I
bought it for you in Paris. You look very handsome
in it.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, come, Jasper,” said her little mistress, “you
said I was squat last night.”
</p>
<p>
“The rich velvet shows up your complexion,”
persisted Jasper. “Put it on, dear; you must make
a good impression.”
</p>
<p>
Accordingly Evelyn allowed herself to be arrayed
in a dress of a curious shade between red and crimson.
Jasper encircled her waist with a red silk
sash; and being further decked with numerous rows
of colored beads, varying in hue from the palest
green to the deepest rose, the heiress pronounced
herself ready to descend.
</p>
<p>
“And where will you go first, dear?” said
Jasper.
</p>
<p>
“I am going straight to find my Uncle Edward.
I have a good deal to say to him. And there is
mother’s note; I think it is all about you. I will
give it to Uncle Edward to give to my Aunt Frances.
I don’t like my Aunt Frances at all, so I will see
Uncle Edward first.”
</p>
<p>
Accordingly Evelyn, in her heavy red dress, her
feet encased in black shoes and white stockings, ran
down-stairs, and having inquired in very haughty
tones of a footman where the Squire was likely to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
be found, presently opened the door of his private
sanctum and peeped in.
</p>
<p>
Even Lady Frances seldom cared to disturb the
Squire when he was in his den, as he called it.
When he raised his eyes, therefore, and saw Evelyn’s
pale face, her light flaxen hair falling in thin strands
about her ears, her big, somewhat light-brown eyes
staring at him, he could not help giving a start of
annoyance.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Uncle Ned, you are not going to be cross
too?” said the little girl. She skipped gaily into
the room, ran up to him, put one arm round his
neck, and kissed him.
</p>
<p>
The Squire looked in a puzzled way at the queer
little figure. Like most men, he knew little or nothing
of the details of dress; he was only aware that his
own wife always looked perfect, that Audrey was
the soul of grace, and that Miss Sinclair presented a
very pretty appearance. He was now, therefore,
only uncomfortable in Evelyn’s presence, not in the
least aware of what was wrong with her, but being
quite certain that Lady Frances would not approve
of her at all.
</p>
<p>
“I have come first to you, Uncle Edward,” said
Evelyn, “because we must transact some business
together.”
</p>
<p>
“Transact some business!” repeated her uncle.
“What long words you use, little girl!”
</p>
<p>
“I have heard my dear mothery talk about transacting
business, so I have picked up the phrase,” replied
Evelyn in thoughtful tones. “Well, Uncle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
Edward, shall we transact? It is best to have things
on a business footing; don’t you think so—eh?”
</p>
<p>
“I think that you are a very strange little person,”
said her uncle. “You are too young to know anything
of business matters; you must leave those
things to your aunt and to me.”
</p>
<p>
“But I am your heiress, don’t forget. This room
will be mine, and all that big estate outside, and
the whole of this gloomy old house when you die.
Is not that so?”
</p>
<p>
“It is so, my child.” The Squire could not help
wincing when Evelyn pronounced his house gloomy.
“But at the same time, my dear Evelyn, things of
that sort are not spoken about—at least not in
England.”
</p>
<p>
“Mothery and I spoke a lot about it; we used to
sit for whole evenings by the fireside and discuss the
time when I should come in for my property. I
mean to make changes when my time comes. You
don’t mind my saying so, do you?”
</p>
<p>
“I object to the subject altogether, Evelyn.” The
Squire rose and faced his small heiress. “In England
we don’t talk of these things, and now that
you have come to England you must do as an English
girl and a lady would. On your father’s side
you are a lady, and you must allow your aunt and
me to train you in the observances which constitute
true ladyhood in England.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn’s brown eyes flashed a very angry fire.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t wish to be different from my mother,”
she said. “My mother was one of the most splendid
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
women on earth. I wish to be exactly like her. I
will not be a fine lady—not for anybody.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, dear, I respect you for being fond of
your mother.”
</p>
<p>
“Fond of her!” said Evelyn; and a strange
and intensely tragic look crossed the queer little
face.
</p>
<p>
She was quite silent for nearly a minute, and
Edward Wynford watched her with curiosity and
pain mingled in his face. Her eyes reminded him
of the brother whom he had so truly loved; in every
other respect Evelyn was her mother over again.
</p>
<p>
“I suppose,” she said after a pause, “although I
may not speak about what lies before me in the
future, and you must die some time, Uncle Edward,
that I may at least ask you to supply me with the
needful?”
</p>
<p>
“The what, dear?”
</p>
<p>
“The needful. Chink, you know—chink.”
</p>
<p>
Squire Wynford sank slowly back again into his
chair.
</p>
<p>
“You might ask me to sit down,” said Evelyn,
“seeing that the room and all it contains will
be——” Here she broke off abruptly. “I beg your
pardon,” she continued. “I really and truly do not
want you to die a minute before your rightful hour.
We all have our hour—at least mothery said so—and
then go we must, whether we like it or not; so,
as you must go some day, and I must——Oh
dear! I am always being drawn up now by that
horrid wish of yours that I should try to be an English
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
girl. I will try to be when I am in your presence,
for I happen to like you; but as for the others,
well, we shall see. But, Uncle Ned, what about the
chink? Perhaps you call it money; anyhow, it
means money. How much may I have out of what
is to be all my own some day to spend now exactly
as I like?”
</p>
<p>
“You can have a fair sum, Evelyn. But, first of
all, tell me what you want it for and how you mean
to spend it.”
</p>
<p>
“I have all kinds of wants,” began Evelyn.
“Jasper had plenty of money to spend on me until I
came here. She manages very well indeed, does
Jasper. We bought lots of things in Paris—this
dress, for instance. How do you like my dress,
Uncle Ned?”
</p>
<p>
“I am not capable of giving an opinion.”
</p>
<p>
“Aren’t you really? I expect you are about
stunned. You never thought a girl like me could
dress with such taste. Do you mind my speaking
to Audrey, Uncle Ned, about her dress? It does
not seem to me to be correct.”
</p>
<p>
“What is wrong with it?” asked the Squire.
</p>
<p>
“It is so awfully dowdy; it is not what a lady
ought to wear. Ladies ought to dress in silks and
satins and brocades and rich embroidered robes.
Mothery always said so, and mothery surely knew.
But there, I am idling you, and I suppose you are
busy directing the management of your estates,
which are to be——Oh, there! I am pulled up
again. I want my money for Jasper, for one thing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
Jasper has got some poor relations, and she and I
between us support them.”
</p>
<p>
“She and you between you,” said the Squire,
“support your maid’s relations!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh dear me, Uncle Ned, how stiffly you speak!
But surely it does not matter; I can do what I like
with my own.”
</p>
<p>
“Listen to me, Evelyn,” said her uncle. “You are
only a very young girl; your mind may in some
ways be older than your body, but you are nothing
more than a child.”
</p>
<p>
“I am not such a child as I look. I was sixteen
a month ago. I am sixteen, and that is not very
young.”
</p>
<p>
“We must agree to differ,” said her uncle. “You
are young and you are not wise; and although there
is some money which is absolutely your own coming
from the ranch in Tasmania, yet I have the charge
of it until you come of age.”
</p>
<p>
“When I come of age I suppose I shall be very,
very rich?”
</p>
<p>
“Not at all. You will be my care, and I will
allow you what is proper, but as long as I live you
will only have the small sum which will come to you
yearly from the rent of the ranch. As the ranch
may possibly be sold some day, we may be able to
realize a nice little capital for you; but you are too
young to know much of these things at present.
The matter in hand, therefore, is all-sufficient. I
will allow you as pocket-money five pounds a
quarter. I give precisely the same sum to Audrey.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
Your aunt will buy your clothes, and you will live
here and be treated in all respects as my daughter.
Now, that is my side of the bargain.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn’s face turned white.
</p>
<p>
“Five pounds a quarter!” she said. “Why, that
is downright penury!”
</p>
<p>
“No, dear; for the use you require it for it is
downright riches. But, be it riches or be it penury,
you get no more.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn looked full at her uncle; her uncle looked
back at her.
</p>
<p>
“Come here, little girl,” he said.
</p>
<p>
Her heart was beating with furious anger, but
there was something in his tone which subdued her.
She went slowly to him, and he put his arm round
her waist.
</p>
<p>
“Your eyes are like—very like—one whom I
loved best on earth.”
</p>
<p>
“You mean my father,” said the girl.
</p>
<p>
“Your father. He left you to me to care for, and
to love and to train—to train for a high position
eventually.”
</p>
<p>
“He left me to mothery; you are quite mistaken
there. Mothery has trained me; father left me to
her. She often and often and often told me so.”
</p>
<p>
“That is true, dear. While your mother lived she
had the prior claim over you, but now you belong
to me.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Evelyn. She felt fascinated. She
snuggled comfortably inside her uncle’s arm; her
strange brown eyes were fixed on his face.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
</p>
<p>
“I give you,” he continued, “the love and care of
a father, but I expect a return.”
</p>
<p>
“What? I don’t mind. I have two diamonds—beauties.
You shall have them to make into studs;
you shall, because I—yes, I love you.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t want your diamonds, my little girl, but
I want other things—your love and your obedience.
I want you, if you like me, and if you like your Aunt
Frances, and if you like your cousin, to follow in our
steps, for we have been brought up to approve of
courteous manners and quiet dress and gentle
speech; and I want that brain of yours, Evelyn, to
be educated to high and lofty thoughts. I want you
to be a grand woman, worthy of your father, and I
expect this return from you for all that I am going
to do for you.”
</p>
<p>
“Are you going to teach me your own self?”
asked Evelyn.
</p>
<p>
“You can come to me sometimes for a talk, but it
is impossible for me to be your instructor. You will
have a suitable governess.”
</p>
<p>
“Jasper knows a lot of things. Perhaps she
could teach both Audrey and me. She might if you
paid her well. She has got some awfully poor relations;
she must have lots of money, poor Jasper
must.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, dear, leave me now. We will talk of
your education and who is to instruct you, and all
about Jasper too, within a few days. You have got
to see the place and to make Audrey’s acquaintance;
and there are some young friends coming to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
Castle for a week. Altogether, you have arrived at
a gay time. Now run away, find your cousin, and
make yourself happy.”
</p>
<p>
Squire Wynford rose as he spoke, and taking
Evelyn’s hand, he led her to the door. He opened
the door wide for her, and saw her go out, and then
he kissed his hand to her and closed the door again.
</p>
<p>
“Poor little mite!” he said to himself. “As
strange a child as I ever saw, but with Frank’s
eyes.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span><a name='chVI' id='chVI'></a>CHAPTER VI.—THE HUNGRY GIRL.</h2>
<p>
Now, the Squire had produced a decidedly softening
effect upon Evelyn, and if she had not had the
misfortune to meet Lady Frances just as she left his
room, much that followed need never taken place.
But Lady Frances, who had never in the very least
returned poor Frank Wynford’s affection for her,
and who had no sentimental feelings with regard to
Evelyn—Lady Frances, who simply regarded the
little girl as a troublesome and very tiresome member
of the family—was not disposed to be too soothing
in her manner.
</p>
<p>
“Come here, my dear,” she said. “Come over
here to the light. What have you got on?”
</p>
<p>
“My pretty red velvet dress,” replied Evelyn,
tossing her head. “A suitable dress for an heiress
like myself.”
</p>
<p>
“Come, this is quite beyond enduring. I want
to speak to you, Evelyn. I have several things to
say. Come into my boudoir.”
</p>
<p>
“But, if you please,” said Evelyn, “I have nothing
to say to you, and I have a great deal to do in other
directions. I am going back to Jasper; she wants
me.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, that reminds me,” began Lady Frances.
“Come in here this moment, my dear.”
</p>
<p>
She took Evelyn’s hand and dragged the unwilling
child into her private apartment. A bright fire
burned in the grate. The room looked cozy, cheerful,
orderly. Lady Frances was a woman of method.
She had piles of papers lying neatly docketed on her
writing-table; a sheaf of unanswered letters lay on
one side. A Remington typewriter stood on a table
near, and a slim-looking girl was standing by the
typewriter.
</p>
<p>
“You will leave me for the present, Miss Andrews,”
she said, turning to her amanuensis. “I
shall require you here again in a quarter of an
hour.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Andrews, with a low bow, instantly left the
room.
</p>
<p>
“You see, Evelyn,” said her aunt, “you are taking
up the time of a very busy woman. I manage the
financial part of several charities—in short, we are
very busy people in this house—and in the morning
I, as a rule, allow no one to interrupt me. When
the afternoon comes I am ready and willing to be
agreeable to my guests.”
</p>
<p>
“But I am not your guest. The house belongs
to me—or at least it will be mine,” said
Evelyn.
</p>
<p>
“You are quite right in saying you are not my
guest. You are my husband’s niece, and in the
future you will inherit his property; but if I hear
you speaking in that rude way again I shall be forced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
to punish you. I can see for myself that you are an
ill-bred girl and will require a vast lot of breaking-in.”
</p>
<p>
“And you think you can do it?” said Evelyn,
her eyes flashing.
</p>
<p>
“I intend to do it. I am going to talk to you
for a few minutes this morning, and after I have
spoken I wish you to clearly understand that you
are to do as I tell you. You will not be unhappy
here; on the contrary, you will be happy. At first
you may find the necessary rules of a house like
this somewhat irksome, but you will get into the
way of them before long. You need discipline, and
you will have it here. I will not say much more on
that subject this morning. You can find Audrey,
and she and Miss Sinclair will take you round the
grounds and amuse you, and you must be very much
obliged to them for their attentions. Audrey is my
daughter, and I think I may say without undue
flattery that you will find her a most estimable companion.
She is well brought up, and is a charming
girl in every sense of the word. Miss Sinclair is
her governess; she will also instruct you, but time
enough for that in the future. Now, when you leave
here go straight to your room and desire your servant—Jasper,
I think, you call her—to dress you in
a plain and suitable frock.”
</p>
<p>
“A frock!” said Evelyn. “I wear dresses—long
dresses. I am not a child; mothery said I had the
sense of several grown-up people.”
</p>
<p>
“The garment you are now in you are not to wear
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>
again; it is unsuitable, and I forbid you to be even
seen in it. Do you understand?”
</p>
<p>
“I hear you,” said Evelyn.
</p>
<p>
“Go up-stairs and do what I tell you, and then you
can go into the grounds. Audrey is having holidays
at present; you will find her with her governess in
the shrubbery. Now go; the time I can devote to
you for the present is up.”
</p>
<p>
“I had better give you this first,” said Evelyn.
</p>
<p>
She thrust her hand into her pocket and took out
the ill-spelt and now exceedingly dirty note which
poor Mrs. Wynford in Tasmania had written to
Lady Frances before her death.
</p>
<p>
“This is from mothery, who is dead,” continued
the child. “It is for you. She wrote it to you. I
expect she is watching you now; she told me that
she would come back if she could and see how
people treated me. I am going. Don’t lose the
note; it was written by mothery, and she is dead.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn laid the dirty letter on the blotting-pad
on Lady Frances’s table. It looked strangely out of
keeping with the rest of her correspondence. The
little girl left the room, banging the door behind her.
</p>
<p>
“A dreadful child!” thought Lady Frances.
“How are we to endure her? My poor, sweet
Audrey! I must get Edward to allow me to send
Evelyn to school; she really is not a fit companion
for my young daughter.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Andrews came back.
</p>
<p>
“Please direct these envelopes, and answer some
of these letters according to the notes which I have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>
put down for you,” said Lady Frances; and her
secretary began to work. But Lady Frances did
not ask Miss Andrews to read or reply to the dirty
little note. She took it up very much as though she
would like to drop it into the fire, but finally she
opened it and read the contents. The letter was
rude and curt, and Lady Frances’s fine black eyes
flashed as she read the words. Finally, she locked
the letter up in a private bureau, and sitting down,
calmly proceeded with her morning’s work.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Evelyn, choking with rage and utterly
determined to disobey Lady Frances, left the room.
She stood still for a moment in the long corridor
and looked disconsolately to right and to left of
her.
</p>
<p>
“How ugly it all is!” she said to herself. “How
I hate it! Mothery, why did you die? Why did
I ever leave my darling, darling ranch in Tasmania?”
</p>
<p>
She turned and very slowly walked up the white
marble staircase. Presently she reached her own
luxurious room. It was in the hands of a maid,
however, who was removing the dust and putting
the chamber in order.
</p>
<p>
“Where is Jasper?” asked the little girl.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Jasper has gone out of doors, miss.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you know how long she has been out?” asked
Evelyn in a tone of keen interest.
</p>
<p>
“About half an hour, miss.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I’ll follow her.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn went to her wardrobe. Jasper had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
already unpacked her young lady’s things and laid
them higgledy-piggledy in the spacious wardrobe.
It took the little girl a long time to find a tall
velvet hat trimmed with plumes of crimson feathers.
This she put on before the glass, arranging her hair
to look as thick as possible, and smirking at her face
while she arrayed herself.
</p>
<p>
“I would not wear this hat, for I got it quite for
Sunday best, but I want her to see that she cannot
master me,” thought the child. She then wrapped
a crimson silk scarf round her neck and shoulders,
and so attired looked very much like a little lady of
the time of Vandyck. Once more she went down-stairs.
</p>
<p>
Audrey she did not wish to meet; Miss Sinclair
she intended to be hideously rude to; but Jasper—where
was Jasper?
</p>
<p>
Evelyn looked all round. Suddenly she saw a
figure on the other side of a small lake which
adorned part of the grounds. The figure was too
far off for her to see it distinctly. It must be Jasper,
for it surely was not in the least like the tall, fair,
and stately Aubrey, not like Miss Sinclair.
</p>
<p>
Picking up her skirts, which were too long for her
to run comfortably, the small figure now skidded
across the grass. She soon reached the side of the
lake, and shouted:
</p>
<p>
“Jasper! Oh Jasper! Jasper, I have news for
you! You never knew anything like the——”
</p>
<p>
The next instant she had rushed into the arms of
Sylvia Leeson. Sylvia cried out eagerly:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
</p>
<p>
“Who are you, and what are you doing here?”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn stared for a moment at the strange girl,
then burst into a hearty laugh.
</p>
<p>
“Do tell me—quick, quick!—are you one of the
Wynfords?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
“I a Wynford!” cried Sylvia. “I only wish I
were. Are you a Wynford? Do you live at the
Castle?”
</p>
<p>
“Do I live at the Castle!” cried Evelyn. “Why,
the Castle is mine—I mean it will be when Uncle
Ned dies. I came here yesterday; and, oh! I am
miserable, and I want Jasper?”
</p>
<p>
“Who is Jasper?”
</p>
<p>
“My maid. Such a darling!—the only person
here who cares in the least for me. Oh, please,
please tell me your name! If you do not live at the
Castle, and if you can assure me from the bottom of
your heart that you do not love any one—any one
who lives in the Castle—why, I will love you. You
are sweetly pretty! What is your name?”
</p>
<p>
“Sylvia Leeson. I live three miles from here, but
I adore the Castle. I should like to come here
often.”
</p>
<p>
“You adore it! Then that is because you know
nothing about it. Do you adore Audrey?”
</p>
<p>
“Is Audrey the young lady of the Castle?”
</p>
<p>
“She is not the young lady of the Castle. <em>I</em> am
the young lady of the Castle. But have you ever
seen her?”
</p>
<p>
“Once; and then she was rude to me.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah! I thought so. I don’t think she could be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
very polite to anybody. Now, suppose you and I
become friends? The Castle belongs to me—or will
when Uncle Ned dies. I can order people to come
or people to go; and I order you to come. You shall
come up to the house with me. You shall have
lunch with me; you shall really. I have got a
lovely suite of rooms—a bedroom of blue-and-silver
and a little sitting-room for my own use; and you
shall come there, and Jasper shall serve us both.
Do you know that you are sweetly pretty?—just
like a gipsy. You are lovely! Will you come with
me now? Do! come at once.”
</p>
<p>
Sylvia laughed. She looked full at Evelyn; then
she said abruptly:
</p>
<p>
“May I ask you a very straight question?”
</p>
<p>
“I love straight questions,” replied Evelyn.
</p>
<p>
“Can you give me a right, good, big lunch? Do
you know that I am very hungry? Were you ever
very hungry?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, sometimes,” replied Evelyn, staring very
hard at her. “I lived on a ranch, you know—or
perhaps you don’t know.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know what a ranch is.”
</p>
<p>
“How funny! I thought everybody knew. You
see, I am not English; I am Tasmanian. My father
was an Englishman, but he died when I was a little
baby, and I lived with mothery—the sweetest, the
dearest, the darlingest woman on earth—on a ranch
in Tasmania. Mothery is dead, and I have come
here, and all the place will belong to me—not to
Audrey—some day. Yes, I was hungry when we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
went on long expeditions, which we used to do in
fine weather, but there was always something handy
to eat. I have heard of people who are hungry and
there is nothing handy to eat. Do you belong to
that sort?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, to that sort,” said Sylvia, nodding. “I
will tell you about myself presently. Yes, take me
to the house, please. I know <em>he</em> will be angry when
he knows it, but I am going all the same.”
</p>
<p>
“Who is he?”
</p>
<p>
“I will tell you about him when you know the
rest. Take me to the house, quick. I was there
once before, on New Year’s Day, when every one—every
one has a right to come. I hope you will keep
up that splendid custom when you get the property.
I ate a lot then. I longed to take some for him, but
it was the rule that I must not do that. I told him
about it afterwards: game-pie, two helpings; venison
pasty, two ditto.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, that is dull!” interrupted Evelyn. “Have
you not forgotten yet about a lunch you had some
days ago?”
</p>
<p>
“You would not if you were in my shoes,” said
Sylvia. “But come; if we stay talking much longer
some one will see us and prevent me from going to
the house with you.”
</p>
<p>
“I should like to find the person who could prevent
me from doing what I like to do!” replied
Evelyn. “Come, Sylvia, come.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn took the tall, dark girl’s hand, and they
both set to running, and entered the house by the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
side entrance. They had the coast clear, as Evelyn
expressed it, and ran up at once to her suite of rooms.
Jasper was not in; the rooms were empty. They
ran through the bedroom and found themselves in
the beautifully furnished boudoir. A fire was blazing
on the hearth; the windows were slightly open;
the air, quite mild and fresh—for the day was like
a spring one—came in at the open casement. Evelyn
ran and shut it, and then turned and faced her companion.
</p>
<p>
“There!” she said. She came close up to Sylvia,
and almost whispered, “Suppose Jasper brings lunch
for both of us up here? She will if I command her.
I will ring the bell and she’ll come. Would you not
like that?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I’d like it much—much the best,” said
Sylvia. “I am afraid of Lady Frances. And Miss
Audrey can be very rude. She was very chuff with
me on New Year’s Day.”
</p>
<p>
“She won’t be chuff with you in my presence,”
said Evelyn. “Ah! here comes Jasper.”
</p>
<p>
Jasper, looking slightly excited, now appeared on
the scene.
</p>
<p>
“Well, my darling!” she said. She rushed up to
Evelyn and clasped her in her arms. “Oh, my own
sweet Eve, and how are you getting on?” she exclaimed.
“I am thinking this is not the place for
you.”
</p>
<p>
“We will talk of that another time, please, Jasper,”
said Evelyn, with unwonted dignity. “I have
brought a friend to lunch with me. This young
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>
lady is called Miss Sylvia Leeson, and she is awfully
hungry, and we’d both like a big lunch in this room.
Can you smuggle things up, Jasper?”
</p>
<p>
“Her ladyship will be mad,” exclaimed Jasper.
“I was told in the servants’ hall that she was downright
annoyed at your not going to breakfast; if you
are not at lunch she will move heaven and earth.”
</p>
<p>
“Let her; it will be fun,” said Evelyn. “I am
going to lunch here with my friend Sylvia Leeson.
Bring a lot of things up, Jasper—good things, rich
things, tempting things; you know what sort I
like.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll try if there is a bit of pork and some mincepies
and plum-pudding and cream and such-like
down-stairs. And you’d fancy your chocolate, would
you not?”
</p>
<p>
“Rather! Get all you can, and be as quick as
ever you can.”
</p>
<p>
Jasper accordingly withdrew, and in a short time
appeared with a laden tray in her hands.
</p>
<p>
“I had to run the gauntlet of the footman and
the butler too; and what they will tell Lady Frances
goodness knows, but I do not,” answered Jasper.
“But there, if things have to come to a crisis, why,
they must. You will not forget me when the storm
breaks, will you, Evelyn?”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll never forget you,” said Evelyn, with enthusiasm.
“You are the dearest and darlingest thing
left now that mothery is in heaven; and Sylvia
will love you too. I have been telling her all about
you.—Now, Sylvia, you will not be hungry long.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span><a name='chVII' id='chVII'></a>CHAPTER VII.—STAYING TO DINNER.</h2>
<p>
Again at luncheon that day Evelyn was missing.
Lady Frances looked round: Audrey was in her
place; Miss Sinclair was seated not far away; the
Squire took the foot of the table; the servants
handed round the different dishes; but still no
Evelyn had put in an appearance.
</p>
<p>
“I wonder where she can be,” said the Squire.
“She looked a little wild and upset when she left
me. Poor little girl! Do you know, Frances, I
feel very sorry for her.”
</p>
<p>
“More than I do,” said Lady Frances, who at the
same time had an uncomfortable remembrance of
the look Evelyn had given her when she had left
her presence. “Don’t let us talk any more about
her now, Edward,” she said to her husband. “There
is only one thing to be done for the child, and that
I will tell you by and by.”
</p>
<p>
The Squire was accustomed to attend to his wife’s
wishes on all occasions, and he said nothing further.
Audrey felt constrained and uncomfortable. After
a slight hesitation she said:
</p>
<p>
“Do let me find Evelyn, mother. I have been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
expecting her to join me the whole morning. She
does not, of course, know about our rules yet.”
</p>
<p>
“No, Audrey,” said her mother; “I prefer that
you should not leave the table.—Miss Sinclair, perhaps
you will oblige me. Will you go to Evelyn’s
room and tell her that we are at lunch?”
</p>
<p>
Miss Sinclair rose at once. She was absent for
about five minutes. When she came back there was
a distressed look on her face.
</p>
<p>
“Well, Jenny, well?” said Audrey in a voice of
suppressed excitement. “Is she coming?”
</p>
<p>
“I think not,” said Miss Sinclair.—“I will explain
matters to you, Lady Frances, afterwards.”
</p>
<p>
“Dear, dear!” said the Squire. “What a lot of
explanations seem to be necessary with regard to the
conduct of one small girl!”
</p>
<p>
“But she is a very important small girl, is she not,
father?” said Audrey.
</p>
<p>
“Well, yes, dear; and I should like to say now
that I take an interest in her—in fact,” he added,
looking round him, for the servants had withdrawn,
“I am prepared to love little Eve very much indeed.”
</p>
<p>
Lady Frances’s eyes flashed a somewhat indignant
fire. Then she said slowly:
</p>
<p>
“As you speak so frankly, Edward, I must do
likewise. I never saw a more hopeless child. There
seems to be nothing whatever for it but to send her
to school for a couple of years.”
</p>
<p>
“No,” said the Squire, “I will not allow that. We
never sent Audrey to school, and I will have no difference
made with regard to Evelyn’s education.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
All that money can secure must be provided for her,
but I do not care for school-life for girls.”
</p>
<p>
Lady Frances said nothing further. She was a
woman with tact, and would not on any consideration
oppose her husband in public. All the same,
she secretly made up her mind that if Evelyn proved
unmanageable she was not to stay at Wynford Castle.
</p>
<p>
“And there is another thing,” continued the Squire.
“This is her first day in her future home. I do not
wish her to be punished whatever she may have done.
I should like her to have absolute freedom until to-morrow
morning.”
</p>
<p>
“It shall be exactly as you wish, Edward,” said
Lady Frances. “I did intend to seek Evelyn out;
I did intend further to question Miss Sinclair as to
the reason why Evelyn did not appear at lunch; but
I will defer these things. It happens to be somewhat
convenient, as I want to pay some calls this
afternoon; and really, with that child on my brain,
I should not enjoy my visits. You, Audrey dear,
will see to your cousin’s comforts, and when she is
inclined to give you her society you will be ready to
welcome her. Your young friends will not arrive
until just before dinner. Please, at least use your
influence, Audrey, to prevent Evelyn making a too
extraordinary appearance to-night. Now I think
that is all, and I must run off if I am to be in time
to receive my guests.”
</p>
<p>
Lady Frances left the room, and Audrey went to
her governess’s side.
</p>
<p>
“What is it?” she said. “You did look strange,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
Jenny, when you came into the room just now.
Where is Evelyn? Why did she not come to lunch?”
</p>
<p>
“It is the greatest possible mercy,” said Miss Sinclair,
“that Evelyn is allowed to have one free day,
for perhaps—although I feel by no means sure—you
and I may influence her for her own good to-night.
But what do you think has happened? I went to
her room and knocked at the door of the boudoir.
I heard voices within. The door was immediately
opened by the maid Jasper, and I saw Evelyn seated
at a table, eating a most extraordinary kind of lunch,
in the company of a girl whom I have never seen
before.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh Jenny,” cried Audrey, “how frightfully exciting!
A strange girl! Surely Evelyn did not
bring a stranger with her and hide her somewhere
last night?”
</p>
<p>
“No, dear, no,” said Miss Sinclair, laughing; “she
did nothing of that sort. I fancy the girl must live
in the neighborhood, although her face is unfamiliar
to me. She is rather a pretty girl, but by no
means the sort that your mother would approve of
as a companion for your cousin.”
</p>
<p>
“What is she like?” asked Audrey in a grave
voice.
</p>
<p>
Miss Sinclair proceeded to describe Sylvia’s appearance.
She was interrupted in the middle of her
description by a cry from Audrey.
</p>
<p>
“Oh dear!” she exclaimed, “you must have seen
that curious girl, Sylvia Leeson. Your description
is exactly like her. Well, as this is a free day, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
we can do pretty much what we like, I will run
straight up to Evelyn’s room and look for myself.”
</p>
<p>
“Do Audrey; I think on the whole it would be
the best plan.”
</p>
<p>
So Audrey ran up-stairs, and soon her tap was
heard on Evelyn’s door; the next moment she found
herself in the presence of a very untidy, disheveled-looking
cousin, and also in that of handsome Sylvia
Leeson.
</p>
<p>
Sylvia dropped a sort of mock courtesy when she
saw Audrey.
</p>
<p>
“My Shakespearian contemporary!” was her remark.
“Well, Audrey, and how goes the Forest of
Arden? And have you yet met Touchstone?”
</p>
<p>
Audrey colored very high at what she considered
a direct impertinence.
</p>
<p>
“What are you doing here?” she said. “My
mother does not know your mother.”
</p>
<p>
Sylvia gave a ringing laugh.
</p>
<p>
“I met this lady,” she said—and she pointed in
Evelyn’s direction—“and she invited me here. I
have had lunch with her, and I am no longer hungry.
This is her room, is it not?”
</p>
<p>
“I should just think it is,” said Evelyn; “and I
only invite those people whom I care about to come
into it.” She said the words in a very pointed way,
but Audrey had now recovered both her dignity and
good-nature.
</p>
<p>
She laughed.
</p>
<p>
“Really we three are too silly,” she said. “Evelyn,
you cannot mean the ridiculous words you say! As
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
if any room in my father’s house is not free to me
when I choose to go there! Now, whether you like it
or not, I am determined to be friends with you. I
do not want to scold you or lecture you, for it is not
my place, but I intend to sit down although you
have not the civility to offer me a chair; and I intend
to ask again why Miss Leeson is here.”
</p>
<p>
“I came because Evelyn asked me,” said Sylvia;
and then, all of a sudden, an unexpected change
came over her face. Her pretty, bright eyes, with a
sort of robin-redbreast look in them, softened and
melted, and then grew brighter than ever through
tears. She went up to Audrey and knelt at her
feet.
</p>
<p>
“Why should not I come? Why should not I be
happy?” she said. “I am a very lonely girl; why
should you grudge me a little happiness?”
</p>
<p>
Audrey looked at her in amazement; then a
change came over her own face. She allowed her
hand just for an instant to touch the hand of Sylvia,
and her eyes looked into the wild eyes of the shabby
girl who was kneeling before her.
</p>
<p>
“Get up,” she said. “You have no right to take
that attitude to me. As you are here, sit down. I
do not want to be rude to you; far from that. I
should like to make you happy.”
</p>
<p>
“Should you really?” answered Sylvia. “You
can do it, you know.”
</p>
<p>
“Sylvia,” interrupted Evelyn, “what does this
mean? You and I have been talking in a very frank
way about Audrey. We have neither of us been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
expressing any enthusiastic opinions with regard to
her; and yet now—and yet now——”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, let me be, Eve,” replied Sylvia. “I like
Audrey. I liked her the other day. It is true I
was afraid of her, and I was crushed by her, but I
liked her; and I like her better now, and if she will
be my friend I am quite determined to be hers.”
</p>
<p>
“Then you do not care for me?” said Evelyn,
getting up and strutting across the room.
</p>
<p>
Sylvia looked at Audrey, whose eyes, however,
would not smile, and whose face was once more cold
and haughty.
</p>
<p>
“Evelyn,” she said, “I must ask you to try and
remember that you are a lady, and not to talk in
this way before anybody but me. I am your cousin,
and when you are alone with me I give you leave
to talk as you please. But now the question is this:
I do not in the least care what Sylvia said of me behind
my back. I hope I know better than to wish
to find out what I was never meant to hear. This
is a free country, and any girl in England can talk
of me as she pleases—I am not afraid—that is, she
can talk of me as she pleases when I am absent.
But what I want to do now is to answer Sylvia’s
question. She is unhappy, and she has thrown herself
on me.—What can I do, Sylvia, to make you
happy?”
</p>
<p>
Sylvia was standing huddled up against the wall.
Her pretty shoulders were hitched to her ears; her
hair was disheveled and fell partly over her forehead;
her eyes gleamed out under their thick thatch
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>
of black hair like wild birds in a nest; her coral lips
trembled, there was just a gleam of snowy teeth, and
then she said impulsively:
</p>
<p>
“You are a darling, and you can do one thing.
Let me for to-day forget that I am poor and hungry
and very lonely and very sad. Let me share your
love and Evelyn’s love for just one whole day.”
</p>
<p>
“But there are people coming to-night, Sylvia,”
said Evelyn. “I heard Jasper speak of it. Lots of
people—grandees, you know.”
</p>
<p>
Sylvia shuddered slightly.
</p>
<p>
“We never say that sort of word now in England,”
she remarked; and she added: “I am well-born too.
There was a time when I should not have been at
all shy of Audrey Wynford.”
</p>
<p>
“You are very queer,” said Evelyn. “I do not
know that I particularly want you for a friend.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, never mind; I think I can get you to love
me,” said Sylvia. “But now the question is this:
Will Audrey let me stay or will she not? Will you,
Audrey—will you—just because my name is Sylvia
and we have met in the Forest of Arden?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh dear,” said Audrey, “what a difficult question
you ask! And how can I answer it? I dare
not give you leave all by myself, but I will go and
inquire.”
</p>
<p>
Audrey ran immediately out of the room.
</p>
<p>
“What a wonderful change has come into my
life!” she said to herself as she flew down-stairs and
looked into different rooms, but all in vain, for Miss
Sinclair.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
</p>
<p>
Her mother was out; it was hopeless to think of
appealing to her. Without the permission of some
one older than herself she could not possibly ask
Sylvia to stay. Sylvia could be more or less lost in
the crowd of children who would be at the Castle
that evening, but her mother’s eyes would quickly
seek out the unfamiliar face, inquiries would be
made, and—in short, Audrey did not dare to take
this responsibility on herself. She was rushing up-stairs
again, prepared to tell Sylvia that she could
not grant her request, when she came plump up
against her father.
</p>
<p>
“My dear girl, what a hurry you are in!” he
exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
“Oh yes, father,” replied Audrey. “I am excited.
The house is full of life and almost mystery.”
</p>
<p>
“Then you like your cousin to be here?” said the
Squire, and his face brightened.
</p>
<p>
“Yes and no,” answered Audrey truthfully.
“But, father, I have a great request to make. You
know you said that Evelyn was to have a free day
to-day in which she could do as she pleased. She
has a guest up-stairs whom she would like to ask to
stay. May she ask her, father? She is a girl, and
lonely and pretty, and, I think, on the whole, a lady.
May we both ask her to dinner and to spend the
evening? And will you, father, take the responsibility?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course—of course,” said the Squire.
</p>
<p>
“Will you explain to mother when she returns?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes, my dear—certainly. Ask anybody you
please; I never restrain you with regard to your
friends. Now do not keep me, my love; I am going
out immediately.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span><a name='chVIII' id='chVIII'></a>CHAPTER VIII.—EVENING-DRESS.</h2>
<p>
When Audrey re-entered Evelyn’s pretty boudoir
she found the two girls standing close together and
talking earnestly. Jasper also was joining in the
conversation. Audrey felt her heart sink.
</p>
<p>
“How can Evelyn make free with Jasper as she
does? And why does Sylvia talk to Evelyn as
though they were having secrets together? Why,
they only met to-day!” was the girl’s thought.
Her tone, therefore, was cold.
</p>
<p>
“I met father, and he says you may stay,” she
remarked in a careless voice. “And now, as doubtless
you will be quite happy, I will run away and
leave you, for I have much to do.”
</p>
<p>
“No, no; not until I have thanked you and
kissed you first,” said Sylvia.
</p>
<p>
Audrey did not wish Sylvia to kiss her, but she
could not make any open objection. She scarcely
returned the girl’s warm embrace, and the next moment
had left the room.
</p>
<p>
“Is she not a horror?” said Evelyn. “I began
by liking her—I mean I rather liked her. She had
a grand sort of manner, and her eyes are handsome,
but I hate her now. She is not half, nor quarter,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
as pretty as you are, Sylvia. And, oh, Sylvia, you
will be my friend—my true, true friend—for I am
so lonely now that mothery is dead!”
</p>
<p>
Sylvia was standing by the fire. There was a
bright color in both her cheeks, and her eyes shone
vividly.
</p>
<p>
“My mother died too,” she said. “I was happy
while she lived. Yes, Eve, I will be your friend if
you like.”
</p>
<p>
“It will be all the better for you,” said Evelyn,
who could never long forget her own importance.
“If I take to you there is no saying what may happen,
for, whatever lies before me in the future, I
am my Uncle Edward’s heiress; and Audrey, for
all her pride, is nobody.”
</p>
<p>
“Audrey looks much more suitable,” said Sylvia,
and then she stopped, partly amused and partly
frightened by the look in Evelyn’s light-brown eyes.
</p>
<p>
“How dare you!” she cried. “How horrid—how
horrid of you! After all, I do not know that
I want to see too much of you. You had better be
careful what sort of things you say to me. And
first of all, if I am to see any more of you, you must
tell me why Audrey would make a better heiress
than I shall.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, never mind,” said Sylvia; but then she
added: “Why should I not tell you? She is tall
and graceful and very, very lovely, and she has the
manners of a <em>grande dame</em> although she is such a
young girl. Any one in all the world can see that
Audrey is to the manner born, whereas you——”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
</p>
<p>
Evelyn looked almost frightened while Sylvia was
talking.
</p>
<p>
“Is that really so?” she answered. “I ought to
be just mad with you, but I’m not. Before the year
is out no one will compare Audrey and me. I shall
be much, much the finest lady—much, much the
grandest. I vow it; I declare it; I will do it; and
you, Sylvia, shall help me.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I have no objection,” said Sylvia. “I am
very glad indeed that you will want my help, and I
am sure you are heartily welcome.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn looked full up at Sylvia. Jasper had left
the two girls together. The only light in the room
now was the firelight, for the short winter day was
drawing to an end.
</p>
<p>
“You, I suppose,” said Evelyn, “are a lady although
you do wear such a shabby dress and you
suffer so terribly from hunger?”
</p>
<p>
“How do you know?” asked Sylvia.
</p>
<p>
“First, because you are not afraid of anything;
and second, because you are graceful and, although
you are so very queer, your voice has a gentle sound.
You are a lady by birth, are you not?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Sylvia simply. She neither added to
the word not took from it. She became very silent
and thoughtful.
</p>
<p>
“Why do you live in such a funny way? Why
are you not educated like other girls? And why
will you tell me nothing about your home?”
</p>
<p>
“I have nothing to tell. My father and I came
to live at The Priory three months ago. He does
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
not care for society, and he does not wish me to leave
him.”
</p>
<p>
“And you are poor?”
</p>
<p>
“No,” said Sylvia.
</p>
<p>
“Not poor! And yet, why are you almost
in rags? And you did eat up your lunch so
greedily!”
</p>
<p>
“I will answer nothing more, Evelyn. If you do
not like me as I am, let me go now, and I will try
to forget the beautiful, comfortable Castle, and the
lovely meals, and you and your queer maid Jasper,
and the beautiful girl Audrey; for if you do not
want me as I am, you can never get me any other
way. I am a lady, and we are not poor. Now are
you satisfied?”
</p>
<p>
“I burn with curiosity,” said Evelyn; “and if
mothery were alive, would she not get it out of you!
But if you wish it—and your eyes do look as if they
were daggers—I will change the subject. What
shall we do for the rest of the day? Shall we go out
and take a walk in the dark?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; that would be lovely,” cried Sylvia.
</p>
<p>
Evelyn shouted in an imperious way to Jasper.
</p>
<p>
“Bring my fur cloak,” she said, “and my goloshes.
I won’t wear anything over my head. I am going
out with Miss Sylvia Leeson.”
</p>
<p>
Jasper brought Evelyn’s cloak, which was lined
with the most lovely squirrel inside and covered
with bright crimson outside, and put it over her
shoulders. Sylvia in her very shabby black cloth
jacket, much too short in the waist and in the arms,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
accompanied her. They ran down-stairs and went
out into the grounds.
</p>
<p>
Now, if there was one thing more than another
which would hopelessly displease Lady Frances, it
was the idea of any of her relations wandering about
after dusk. But luckily for Evelyn, and luckily also
for poor Sylvia, Lady Frances was some miles from
Wynford Castle at that moment. The girls rushed
about, and soon Evelyn forgot all her restraints and
shouted noisily. They played hide-and-seek amongst
the trees in the plantation. Sylvia echoed Evelyn’s
shouts; and the Squire, who was returning to the
house in time to meet his guests, paused and listened
in much amazement to these unusual sounds of girlish
laughter. There came a shrill shriek, and then
the cry, “Here I am—seek and find,” and then another
ringing peal of girlish merriment.
</p>
<p>
“Surely that cannot be Audrey!” he said to
himself. “What extraordinary noises!”
</p>
<p>
He went into the house. From his study window
he saw the flash of a lantern, which lit up a red
cloak, and for an instant he observed the very light
hair and white face of his niece. But who was the
girl with her—a tall, shabby-looking girl—about the
height of his Audrey, too? It could not be Audrey!
He sank down into a chair, and a look of perplexity
crossed his face.
</p>
<p>
“What am I to do with that poor child?” he said
to himself. “What extraordinary, unpardonable
conduct! Well, I will not tell Lady Frances. I
determined that the child should have one day of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
liberty, but I am glad I did not make it more than
one.”
</p>
<p>
After Evelyn and Sylvia had quite exhausted
themselves they returned to the house.
</p>
<p>
Jasper was ready for them. She had laid out
several dresses for Evelyn to select from.
</p>
<p>
“I have just had a message from her ladyship,”
she said when the girls came in with their cheeks
glowing and eyes full of laughter. “All the young
people are to dine with the family to-night. As a
rule, when there is company the younger members of
the house dine in the schoolroom, but to-night you
are all to be together. I got the message from that
stuck-up footman Scott. I hate the fellow; he had
the impudence to say that he did not think I was
suited to my post.”
</p>
<p>
“He had better not say it again,” cried Evelyn,
“or he will catch it from me. I mean to have a
talk with each of the servants in turn, and tell them
quite openly that at any moment I may be mistress,
and that they had better look sharp before they
incur my displeasure.”
</p>
<p>
“But, Eve, could you?” exclaimed Sylvia.
“Why, that would mean——”
</p>
<p>
“Uncle Ned’s death. I know that,” said Evelyn.
“I love Uncle Ned. I shall be awfully sorry when
he does die. But however sorry I am, he will die
when his turn comes; and then I shall be mistress.
I was frightfully sorry when mothery died; but
however broken-hearted I was, she did die just the
same. It is so with every one. It is the height of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
folly to shirk subjects of that sort; one has to face
them. I have no one now to take my part except
dear old Jasper, and so I shall have to take my own
part, and the servants had better know.—You can
tell them too, Jasper; I give you leave.”
</p>
<p>
“Not I!” said Jasper. “I declare, Miss Evelyn,
you are no end of a goose for all that you are the
darling of my heart. But now, miss, what dress
will you wear to-night? I should say the white
satin embroidered with the seed pearls. It has a
long train, and you will look like a bride in it, miss.
It is cut low in the neck, and has those sleeves which
open above the elbow, and a watteau back. It is a
very elegant robe indeed; and I have a wreath of
white stephanotis for your hair, miss. You will
look regal in this dress, and like an heiress, I do
assure you, Miss Eve.”
</p>
<p>
“It is perfectly exquisite!” said Evelyn. “Come,
Sylvia; come and look. Oh, those dear little
bunches of chiffon, and white stephanotis in the
middle of each bunch! And, oh, the lace! It is
real lace, is it not, Jasper?”
</p>
<p>
“Brussels lace, and of the best quality; not
too much, and yet enough. It cost a small fortune.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, here are the dear little shoes to match, and
this petticoat with heaps of lace and embroidery!
Well, when I wear this dress Audrey will have to
respect me.”
</p>
<p>
“That is why I bought it, miss. I thought you
should have the best.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you are a darling! What would not mothery
say if she could look at me to-night!”
</p>
<p>
“Well, Miss Evelyn, I hope I do my duty. But
you and Miss Sylvia have been very late out, so you
must hurry, miss, if I am to do you justice.”
</p>
<p>
“But, oh, I say!” cried Evelyn, looking for
the first time at her friend. “What is Sylvia to
wear?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know, miss. None of your dresses will
fit her; she is so much taller.”
</p>
<p>
“I will not go down-stairs a fright,” said Sylvia.
“Audrey asked me, and she must lend me something.
Please, Jasper, do go to Miss Wynford’s
room and ask her if she has a white dress she will
lend me to wear to-night. Even a washing muslin
will do. Anything that is long enough in the skirt
and not too short in the waist. I will take it away
and have it washed fresh for her. Do, please, please,
ask her, Jasper!”
</p>
<p>
“I am very sorry, miss,” answered Jasper. “I
would do anything in reason to oblige, but to go
to a young lady whom I don’t know and to make
a request of that sort is more than I can do, miss.
Besides, she is occupied now. A whole lot of visitors
have just arrived—fine young ladies and tall young
gentlemen—and they are all chittering-chattering
as though their lungs would burst. They are all in
the hall, miss, chatting as hard as they can chat.
No, I cannot ask her; I cannot really.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I must stop up-stairs and lose all, all the
fun,” said Sylvia.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
</p>
<p>
The gaiety left her face. She sat down on a
chair.
</p>
<p>
“You will get me something to eat, at any rate,
Jasper?” she said.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, of course, miss; you and I can have a cozy
meal together.”
</p>
<p>
“No, thank you,” said Sylvia proudly. “I don’t
eat with servants.”
</p>
<p>
Jasper’s face turned an ugly green color. She
looked at Evelyn, but Evelyn only laughed.
</p>
<p>
“You want to be put in your place, Jas,” was her
remark. “You are a little uppish, you know. I am
quite pleased with Sylvia. I think she can teach
me one or two things.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” exclaimed Jasper, “if it is to be cruel and
nasty to your own old Jasper, I wish you joy of your
future, Miss Evelyn; that I do.—And I am sure,
miss,” she added, flashing angry eyes at the unconscious
Sylvia, “I do not want to eat with you—not
one bit. I am sure your dress ain’t fit for any lady
to wear.”
</p>
<p>
Sylvia got up slowly.
</p>
<p>
“I am going to look for Audrey,” she said; and
before Evelyn could prevent her, she left the room.
</p>
<p>
“Ain’t she a spiteful, nasty thing!” said the maid
the moment Sylvia’s back was turned. “Ain’t
she just the very sort that your mother would be
mad at your knowing! And I willing to be kind
to her and all, and to have a dull evening for her
sake, and she ups and cries, ‘I don’t eat with servants.’
Forsooth! I like her ways! I hope, Miss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
Evelyn, you won’t have nothing more to do with
her.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh dear!” said Evelyn, lying back in her chair
and going off into one peal of laughter after another.
“You really kill me, Jas, with your silly ways. It
was fun to see Sylvia when she spoke like that.
And didn’t she take a rise out of you! And was
not your pecker up! Oh, it was killing—killing!”
</p>
<p>
“I am surprised to hear you talk, Miss Evelyn,
as you do. You have already forgotten your poor
mother and what she said I was to be to you.”
</p>
<p>
“I have not forgotten her, Jas; but I mean to
have great fun with Sylvia, and whether you like it
or not you will have to lump it. Oh, I say, she has
come back!—Well, Sylvia? Why, you have got a
lovely dress hanging over your arm!”
</p>
<p>
“It is the best I could get,” said Sylvia. “I went
to Audrey’s wardrobe and took it out. I did not
ask her leave; she was not in the room. There were
numbers of dresses, all hanging on pegs, and I took
this one. See, it is only India muslin, and it can be
washed and done up beautifully. I am determined
to have my one happy evening without being docked
of any of it, and I could not come down in my own
frock. See, Evelyn; do you think it will do?”
</p>
<p>
“It looks rather raggy,” said Evelyn, gazing at
the white India muslin, with its lovely lace and chiffon
and numerous little tucks, with small favor;
“but I suppose it is better than nothing.”
</p>
<p>
“I borrowed this white sash too,” said Sylvia,
“and those shoes and stockings. I am certain to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
found out. I am certain never to be allowed to
come to the Castle again; but I mean to have one
really great evening of grand fun.”
</p>
<p>
“And I won’t help you to dress,” said Jasper.
</p>
<p>
“But you will, Jasper, because I order it,” cried
the imperious little Evelyn. “Only,” she added,
“you must dress me first; and then, while you are
helping Sylvia to look as smart as she can in that
old rag, I will strut up and down before the glass
and try to imagine myself a bride and the owner of
Wynford Castle.”
</p>
<p>
Jasper was, after all, too much afraid of Evelyn
not to yield to her will, and the dressing of the extraordinary
girl began. She was very particular
about the arranging of her hair, and insisted on
having a dash of powder on her face; finally, she
found herself in the satin robe with its magnificent
adornings. Her hair was once again piled on the
top of her head, a wreath of stephanotis surrounding
it, and she stood in silent ecstasy gazing at her image
in the glass.
</p>
<p>
It was now Sylvia’s turn to be appareled for the
festive occasion, and Jasper at first felt cross and
discontented as she took down the girl’s masses of
raven-black hair and began to brush them out; but
soon the magnificence of the locks, which were tawny
in places, and brightened here and there with threads
of almost gold, interested her so completely that she
could not rest until she had made what she called
the best of Sylvia’s head.
</p>
<p>
With all her faults, Jasper could on occasions have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
taste enough, and she soon made Sylvia look as she
had seldom looked before. Her thick hair was piled
high on her small and classical head; the white
muslin dress fitted close to her slim young figure;
and when she stood close to Evelyn, and they prepared
to go down-stairs together, Sylvia, even in her
borrowed plumes, even in the dress which was practically
a stolen dress, looked fifty times more the
heiress than the overdressed and awkward little real
heiress.
</p>
<p>
When the girls reached the large central hall they
both stopped. Audrey was standing near the log
fire, and a group of bright and beautifully dressed
children clustered round her. Two of the girls wore
muslin frocks; their hair, bright in color and very
thick in quantity, hung down below their waists.
There were a couple of boys in the proverbial Eton
jackets; and another pair of girls of ordinary appearance,
but with intelligent faces and graceful figures.
Audrey gave a perceptible start when she saw her
cousin and Sylvia coming to meet her. Just for an
instant Sylvia looked awkward. Audrey’s eyes
slightly dilated; then she came slowly forward.
</p>
<p>
“Evelyn,” she said, “may I introduce my special
friends? This is Henrietta Jervice, and this is
Juliet; and here is Arthur, and here Robert. Can
you remember so many names all at once? Oh,
here are Mary Clavering and Sophie.—Now, my
dears,” she added, turning and laughing back at the
group, “you have all heard of Evelyn, have you not?
This young lady is Miss Sylvia——”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>
</p>
<p>
“Sylvia Leeson,” said Sylvia. A vivid color came
into her cheeks; she drew herself up tall and erect;
her black eyes flashed an angry fire.
</p>
<p>
Audrey looked at her with a slow and puzzled
expression. She certainly was very handsome; but
where had she got that dress? Sylvia seemed to
read the thoughts in Audrey’s heart. She bent
towards her.
</p>
<p>
“I will send it back next week. You were not
in your room. It was time to dress for dinner. I
ran in and took it. If you cannot forgive me I will
make an excuse to go up-stairs, and I will take it off
and put it back again in your wardrobe, and I will
slip home and no one will be the wiser. I know
you meant to lend me a dress, for I could not come
down in my old rags; but if I have offended you
past forgiveness I will go quietly away and no one
will miss me.”
</p>
<p>
“Stay,” said Audrey coldly. She turned round
and began to talk to Henrietta Jervice.
</p>
<p>
Henrietta laughed and chatted incessantly. She
was a merry girl, and very good-looking; she was
tall for her age, which was between sixteen and
seventeen. Both she and her sister were quite
schoolgirls, however, and had frank, fresh manners,
which made Sylvia’s heart go out to them.
</p>
<p>
“How nice people in my own class of life really
are!” she thought. “How dreadful—oh, how
dreadful it is to have to live as I do! And I see by
Audrey’s face that she thinks that I have not the
slightest idea how a lady ought to act. Oh, it is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
terrible! But there, I will enjoy myself for the
nonce; I will—I vow it. Poor little Evelyn, however
<em>gauche</em> she is, and however ridiculous, has small
chance against Audrey. Even if she is fifty times
the heiress, Audrey has the manners of one born to
rule. Oh, how I could love her! How happy she
could make me!”
</p>
<p>
“Do you skate?” suddenly asked Arthur Jervice.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” replied Sylvia bluntly. She turned and
looked at him. He looked back at her, and his
eyes laughed.
</p>
<p>
“I wonder what you are thinking about?” he
said. “You look as if——”
</p>
<p>
“As if what?” said Sylvia. She drew back a
little, and Arthur did the same.
</p>
<p>
“As if you meant to run swords into us all. But,
all the same, I like your look. Are you staying
here?”
</p>
<p>
“No,” said Sylvia. “I live not far away. I have
come here just for the day.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, we shall see you to-morrow, of course.
Mr. Wynford says we can skate on the pond to-morrow,
for the ice will be quite certain to bear. I
hope you will come. I love good skating.”
</p>
<p>
“And so do I,” said Sylvia.
</p>
<p>
“Then will you come?”
</p>
<p>
“Probably not.”
</p>
<p>
Arthur was silent for a moment. He was a tall
boy for his age, and was a good half-head above
Sylvia, tall as she also was.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
</p>
<p>
“May I ask you about things?” he said. “Who
is that very, very funny little girl?”
</p>
<p>
“Do you mean Eve Wynford?”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps that is her name. I mean the girl in
white satin—the girl who wears a grown-up
dress.”
</p>
<p>
“She is Audrey Wynford’s cousin.”
</p>
<p>
“What! the Tasmanian? The one who is
to——”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Hush! she will hear us,” said Sylvia.
</p>
<p>
The rustle of silk was heard on the stairs. Sylvia
turned her head, and instinctively hid just behind
Arthur; and Lady Frances, accompanied by several
other ladies, all looking very stately and beautiful,
joined the group of young people. A great deal
of chattering and laughter followed. Evelyn was
in her element. She was not a scrap shy, and going
up to her aunt, said in a confident way:
</p>
<p>
“I hope you like this dress, Aunt Frances. Jasper
chose it for me in Paris. It is quite Parisian, is it
not? Don’t you think it stylish?”
</p>
<p>
“Hush, Evelyn!” said Lady Frances in a peremptory
whisper. “We do not talk of dress except
in our rooms.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn pouted and bit her lip. Then she saw
Sylvia, whose eyes were watching Lady Frances.
Lady Frances also looked up and saw the tall and
beautiful girl at the same moment.
</p>
<p>
“Who is that girl?” she said, turning to Evelyn.
“I don’t know her face.”
</p>
<p>
“Her name is Sylvia Leeson.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
</p>
<p>
“Sylvia Leeson! Still I don’t understand. Who
is she?”
</p>
<p>
“A friend of mine,” said Evelyn.
</p>
<p>
“My dear, how can you possibly have any friends
in this place?”
</p>
<p>
“She is my friend, Aunt Frances. I found her
wandering about out of doors, and I brought her in;
and Audrey asked her to stay for the rest of the
day, and she is happy. She is very nice, Aunt
Frances,” said Evelyn, looking up full in her aunt’s
face.
</p>
<p>
“That will do, dear.”
</p>
<p>
Lady Frances went up to her daughter.
</p>
<p>
“Audrey,” she said, “introduce me to Miss Leeson.”
</p>
<p>
The introduction was made. Lady Frances held
out her hand.
</p>
<p>
“I am glad to see you, Miss Leeson,” she said.
</p>
<p>
A few minutes later the whole party found themselves
clustered round the dinner-table. The children,
by special request, sat all together. They chattered
and laughed heartily, and seemed to have a
world of things to say each to the other. Audrey,
surrounded by her own special friends, looked her
very best; she had a great deal of tact, and had
long ago been trained in the observances of society.
She managed now, helped by a warning glance from
her mother, to divide Sylvia and Evelyn. She put
Sylvia next to Arthur, who continued to chat to
her, and to try to draw information from her.
Evelyn sat between Robert and Sophie Clavering.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
Sophie was downright and blunt, and she made
Evelyn laugh many times. Sylvia, too, was now
quite at her ease. She contrived to fascinate Arthur,
who thought her quite the most lovely girl he had
ever met.
</p>
<p>
“I wish you would come and skate to-morrow,”
he said, as the dinner was coming to an end and the
signal for the ladies to withdraw might be expected
at any moment. “I wish you would, Sylvia. I cannot
see why you should refuse. One has so little
chance of skating in England that no one ought to
be off the ice who knows how to skate when the
weather is suitable. Cannot you come? Shall I
ask Lady Frances if you may?”
</p>
<p>
“No, thank you,” said Sylvia; then she added:
“I long to skate just as much as you do, and I probably
shall skate, although not on your pond; but
there is a long reach of water just where the pond
narrows and beyond where the stream rushes away
towards the river. I may skate there. The water
is nearly a mile in extent.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I will meet you,” said Arthur. “I will
get Robert and Hennie to come with me; Juliet
will never stir from Audrey’s side when she comes
to Castle Wynford; but I’ll make up a party and
we can meet at the narrow stretch. What do you
call it?”
</p>
<p>
“The Yellow Danger,” said Sylvia promptly.
</p>
<p>
“What a curious name! What does it mean?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know; I have not been long enough in
this neighborhood. Oh, there is Lady Frances rising
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
from the table; I must go. If you do happen to
come to the Yellow Danger to-morrow I shall probably
be there.”
</p>
<p>
She nodded to him, and followed the rest of the
ladies and the girls to one of the drawing-rooms.
</p>
<p>
Soon afterwards games of all sorts were started,
and the children, and their elders as well, had a right
merry time. There was no one smarter at guessing
conundrums and proposing vigorous games of chance
than Sylvia. The party was sufficiently large to
divide itself into two groups, and “clumps,” amongst
other games, was played with much laughter and
vigor. Finally, the whole party wandered into the
hall, where an impromptu dance was struck up, and
in this also Sylvia managed to excel herself.
</p>
<p>
“Who is that remarkably graceful and handsome
girl?” said Mrs. Jervice to Lady Frances.
</p>
<p>
“My dear Agnes,” was the answer, “I have not the
slightest idea. She is a girl from the neighborhood;
that terrible aborigine Evelyn picked her up.
She certainly is handsome, and clever too; and she
is well dressed. That dress she has on reminds me
of one which I bought for Audrey in Paris last
year. I suppose the girl’s people are very well off,
for that special kind of muslin, with its quantities of
real lace, would not be in the possession of a poor
girl. On the whole, I like the girl, but the way in
which Evelyn has brought her into the house is
beyond enduring.”
</p>
<p>
“My Arthur has quite lost his heart to her,” said
Mrs. Jervice, with a laugh. “He said something to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
me about asking her to join our skating party to-morrow.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, dear, I will make inquiries, and if she belongs
to any nice people I will call on her mother
if she happens to have one; but I make it a rule to
be very particular what girls Audrey becomes
acquainted with.”
</p>
<p>
“And you are quite right,” said Mrs. Jervice.
“Any one can see how very carefully your Audrey
has been brought up.”
</p>
<p>
“She is a sweet girl,” said the mother, “and repays
me for all the trouble I have taken with her; but
what I shall do with Evelyn is a problem, for her
uncle has put down his foot and declares that go to
school she shall not.”
</p>
<p>
The ladies moved away, chatting as they did so.
The music kept up its merry sounds; the young feet
tripped happily over the polished floor; all went on
gaily, and Sylvia felt herself in paradise. Warmed
and fed, petted and surrounded by luxury, she looked
a totally different creature from the wild, defiant
girl who had pushed past Audrey in order to have a
hearty meal on New Year’s Day.
</p>
<p>
But by and by the happy evening came to an end,
and Sylvia ran up to Evelyn.
</p>
<p>
“It is time for me to go,” she said. “I must say
good night to Lady Frances; and then will you
take me to your room just to change my dress,
Evelyn?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, what a nuisance you are!” said Evelyn. “I
am not thinking of going to bed yet.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes; but you are at home, remember. I have
to go to my home.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I do not see why I should go to bed an
hour before I wish to. Do go if you wish, Sylvia;
I will see you another time. You will find Jasper
up-stairs, and she will do anything for you you
want.”
</p>
<p>
Sylvia said nothing more. She stood silent for
a minute; then noticing Lady Frances in the distance,
she ran up to her.
</p>
<p>
“Good night, Lady Frances,” she said; “and thank
you very much.”
</p>
<p>
“I am glad you have enjoyed yourself, Miss
Leeson,” said the lady. She looked full into the
sparkling eyes, and suddenly felt a curious drawing
towards the girl. “Tell me where you live,” she
said, “and who your mother is; I should like to
have the pleasure of calling on her.”
</p>
<p>
Sylvia’s face suddenly became white. Her eyes
took on a wild and startled glance.
</p>
<p>
“I have no mother,” she said slowly; “and please
do not call, Lady Frances—please don’t.”
</p>
<p>
“As you please, of course,” said Lady Frances in a
very stiff tone. “I only thought——”
</p>
<p>
“I cannot explain. I cannot help what you think
of me. I know I shall not see you, perhaps, ever
again—I mean, ever again like this,” said Sylvia;
“but thank you all the same.”
</p>
<p>
She made a low courtesy, but did not even see the
hand which Lady Frances was prepared to hold out.
The next instant she was skimming lightly up-stairs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>
</p>
<p>
“Audrey,” said Lady Frances, turning to her
daughter, “who is that girl?”
</p>
<p>
“I cannot tell you, mother. Her name is Sylvia
Leeson. She lives somewhere near, I suppose.”
</p>
<p>
“She is fairly well-bred, and undoubtedly handsome,”
said Lady Frances. “I was attracted by her
appearance, but when I asked her if I might call
on her mother she seemed distressed. She said her
mother was dead, and that I was not to call.”
</p>
<p>
“Poor girl!” said Audrey. “You upset her by
talking about her mother, perhaps.”
</p>
<p>
“I do not think that was it. Do you know anything
at all about her, Audrey?”
</p>
<p>
“Nothing at all, mother, except that I suppose she
lives in the neighborhood, and I am sure she is desperately
poor.”
</p>
<p>
“Poor, with that dress!” said Lady Frances.
“My dear, you talk rubbish.”
</p>
<p>
Audrey opened her lips as if to speak; then she
shut them again.
</p>
<p>
“I think she is poor notwithstanding the dress,”
she said in a low voice. “But where is she? Has
she gone?”
</p>
<p>
“She bade me good-night a minute ago and ran
up-stairs.”
</p>
<p>
“But Evelyn has not gone up-stairs. Has she let
her go alone?”
</p>
<p>
“Just what I should expect of your cousin,” said
Lady Frances.
</p>
<p>
Audrey crossed the hall and went up to Evelyn’s
side.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
</p>
<p>
“Do you notice that Sylvia has gone up-stairs?”
she said. “Have you let her go alone?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Don’t bother,” said Evelyn.—“What are
you saying, Bob?—that you can cut the figure eight
in——”
</p>
<p>
Audrey turned away with an expression of disgust.
A moment later she said something to her friend
Juliet and ran up-stairs herself.
</p>
<p>
“What are we to do with Evelyn?” was her
thought.
</p>
<p>
The same thought was passing through the
minds of almost all the matrons present; but
Evelyn herself imagined that she was most fascinating.
</p>
<p>
Audrey went to Evelyn’s bedroom. There she
saw Sylvia already arrayed in her ugly, tattered,
and untidy dress. She looked like a different girl.
She was pinning her battered sailor-hat on her head;
the color had left her cheeks, and her eyes were no
longer bright. When she saw Audrey she pointed
to the muslin dress, which was lying neatly folded
on a chair.
</p>
<p>
“I am going to take it home; it shall be washed,
and you shall have it back again.”
</p>
<p>
“Never mind about that,” answered Audrey; “I
would rather you did not trouble.”
</p>
<p>
“Very well—as you like; and thank you, Miss
Wynford, a hundred times. I have had a heavenly
evening—something to live for. I shall live on the
thoughts of it for many and many a day. Good
night, Miss Wynford.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>
</p>
<p>
“But stay!” cried Audrey—“stay! It is nearly
midnight. How are you going to get home?”
</p>
<p>
“I shall get home all right,” said Sylvia.
</p>
<p>
“You cannot go alone.”
</p>
<p>
“Nonsense! Don’t keep me, please.”
</p>
<p>
Before Audrey had time to say a word Sylvia had
rushed down-stairs. A side-door was open, she ran
out into the night. Audrey stood still for a moment;
then she saw Jasper, who had come silently into the
room.
</p>
<p>
“Follow that young lady immediately,” she said.
“Or, stay! Send one of the servants. The servant
must find her and go home with her. I do not know
where she lives, but she cannot be allowed to go out
by herself at this hour of night.”
</p>
<p>
Jasper ran down-stairs, and Audrey waited in
Evelyn’s pretty bedroom. Already there were
symptoms all over the room of its new owner’s
presence; a marked disarrangement of the furniture
had already taken place. The room, from being the
very soul of order, seemed now to represent the very
spirit of unrest. Jasper came back, panting slightly.
</p>
<p>
“I sent a man after the young lady, miss, but she
is nowhere to be seen. I suppose she knows how to
find her way home.”
</p>
<p>
Audrey was silent for a minute or two; then
taking up the dress which Sylvia had worn, she hung
it over her arm.
</p>
<p>
“Shall I take that back to your room, miss?”
</p>
<p>
“No, thank you; I will take it myself,” replied
the girl.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>
</p>
<p>
She walked slowly down the passage, descended
some steps, and entered her own pretty room in a
distant wing. She opened her wardrobe and hung
up the dress.
</p>
<p>
“I do hope one thing,” thought Audrey. “Yes,
I earnestly hope that mother will never, never discover
that poor Sylvia wore my dress. Poor Sylvia!
Who is she? Where does she live? What is she?”
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Sylvia Leeson was walking fast through
the dark and silent night. She was not at all afraid;
nor did she choose the frequented paths. On the
contrary, after plunging through the shrubbery, she
mounted a stile, got into a field, crossed it, squeezed
through a hedge at the farther end, and so, by devious
paths and many unexpected windings, found herself
at the entrance of a curious, old-fashioned house.
The house was surrounded by thick yew-trees, which
grew up almost to the windows. There was a wall
round it, and the enclosed space within was evidently
very confined. In the gleam of light which came
now and then through wintry, driving clouds, a stray
flower-bed or a thick holly-bush was visible, but the
entire aspect of the place was gloomy, neglected, and
disagreeable in the extreme. Sylvia pushed a certain
spring in the gate; it immediately opened, and she
let herself in. She closed the gate softly and silently
behind her, and then, looking eagerly around, began
to approach the house. The house stood not thirty
yards from the gate. Sylvia now for the first time
showed symptoms of fear. Suddenly a big dog in a
kennel near uttered a bay. She called his name.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
</p>
<p>
“Pilot, it is I,” she said.
</p>
<p>
The dog ambled towards her; she put her hand
on his neck, bent down, and kissed him on the forehead.
He wagged his tail, and thrust his cold nose
into her hand. She then stood in a listening attitude,
her head thrown back; presently, still holding
the dog by the collar, she went softly—very softly—round
the house. She came to a low window, which
was protected by some iron bars.
</p>
<p>
“Good night, Pilot,” she said then. “Good night,
darling; go back and guard the house.”
</p>
<p>
The dog trotted swiftly and silently away. When
he was quite out of sight Sylvia put up her hand and
removed one bar from the six which stood in front
of the window. A moment later the window had
been opened and the girl had crept within. When
inside she pushed the bar which had been previously
loosened back into its place, shut the window softly,
and crossing the room into which she had entered,
stole up-stairs, trembling as she did so. Suddenly a
door from above was opened, a light streamed
across the passage, and a man’s voice said:
</p>
<p>
“Who goes there?”
</p>
<p>
There was an instant’s silence on the part of Sylvia.
The voice repeated the question in a louder key.
</p>
<p>
“It is I, father,” she answered. “I am going to
bed. It is all right.”
</p>
<p>
“You impertinent girl!” said the man. “Where
have you been all this time? I missed you at dinner;
I missed you at supper. Where have you
been?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
</p>
<p>
“Doing no harm, father. It is all right; it is
really. Good night, father.”
</p>
<p>
The light, however, did not recede from the passage.
A man stood in the entrance to a room.
Sylvia had to pass this man to get to her own bedroom.
She was thoroughly frightened now. She
was shaking all over. As she approached, the man
took up the candle he held and let its light fall full
on her face.
</p>
<p>
“Where have you been?” he said roughly.
</p>
<p>
“Out, father—out; doing no harm.”
</p>
<p>
“What, my daughter—at this time of night! You
know I cannot afford a servant; you know all about
me, and yet you desert me for hours and hours.
Aren’t you ashamed of yourself? You have been
out of doors all this long time and supper ready for
you on the table! Oatmeal and skimmed milk—an
excellent meal; a princess could not desire better.
I am keeping it for your breakfast. You shall have
no supper now; you deserve to go to bed supper-less,
and you shall. What a disgraceful mess your
dress is in!”
</p>
<p>
“There has been snow, and it is wintry and cold
outside,” replied Sylvia; “and I am not hungry.
Good night, father.”
</p>
<p>
“You think to get over me like that! You have
no pity for me; you are a most heartless girl. You
shall not stir from here until you tell me where you
have been.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I will tell you, father. I know you’ll be
angry, but I cannot help it. There is such a thing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
as dying for want of—oh, not for want of food, and
not for want of clothes—for want of pleasure, fun,
life, the joy of being alive. I did go, and I am not
ashamed.”
</p>
<p>
“Where?” asked the man.
</p>
<p>
“I went to Wynford Castle. I have spent the
evening there. Now, you may be as angry as you
please, but you shall not scold me; no, not a word
until the morning.”
</p>
<p>
With a sudden movement the girl flitted past the
angry man. The next instant she had reached her
room. She opened the door, shut it behind her,
and locked herself in. When she was quite alone
she pulled off her hat, and got with frantic speed
out of her wet jacket; then she clasped her hands
high above her head.
</p>
<p>
“How am I to bear it! What have I done that
I should be so miserable?” she thought.
</p>
<p>
She flung herself across the bare, uninviting bed,
and lay there for some time sobbing heavily. All
the joy and animation had left her young frame; all
the gaiety had departed from her. But presently
her passionate sobs came to an end; she undressed
and got into bed.
</p>
<p>
She was bitterly—most bitterly—cold, and it was
a long time before the meager clothes which covered
her brought any degree of warmth to her frame.
But by-and-by she did doze off into a troubled slumber.
In her sleep she dreamt of her mother—her
mother who was dead.
</p>
<p>
She awoke presently, and opening her eyes in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
midst of the darkness, the thought of her dream
came back to her. She remembered a certain night
in her life when she had been awakened suddenly to
say good-by to her mother. The mother had asked
the father to leave the child alone with her.
</p>
<p>
“You will be always good to him, Sylvia?” she
said then. “You will humor him and be patient.
I hand my work on to you. It was too much for
me, and God is taking me away, but I pass it on to
you. If you promise to take the burden and carry
it, and not to fail, I shall die happy. Will you,
Sylvia—will you?”
</p>
<p>
“What am I to do, mother?” asked the child.
She was a girl of fourteen then.
</p>
<p>
“This,” said the mother: “do not leave him
whatever happens.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you mean it, mother? He may go away
from here; he may go into the country; he may—do
anything. He may become worse—not better.
Am I never to be educated? Am I never to be
happy? Do you mean it?”
</p>
<p>
The dying woman looked solemnly at the eager
child.
</p>
<p>
“I mean it,” she said; “and you must promise
me that you will not leave him whatever happens.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I promise you, mother,” Sylvia had said.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span><a name='chIX' id='chIX'></a>CHAPTER IX.—BREAKFAST IN BED.</h2>
<p>
The day of Evelyn’s freedom came to an end.
No remark had been made with regard to her extraordinary
dress; no comments when she declined
to accompany her own special guest to her bedroom.
She was allowed to have her own sweet
will. She went up-stairs very late, and, on the
whole, not discontented. She had enjoyed her chat
with some of the strange children who had arrived
that afternoon. Lady Frances had scarcely looked
at her. That fact did not worry her in the least.
She had said good-night in quite a patronizing tone
to both her aunt and uncle, she did not trouble even
to seek for Audrey, and went up to her room singing
gaily to herself. She had a fine, strong contralto
voice, and she had not the slightest idea of keeping
it in suppression. She sang the chorus of a common-place
song which had been popular on the ranch.
Lady Frances quite shuddered as she heard her.
Presently Evelyn reached her own room, where
Jasper was awaiting her. Jasper knew her young
mistress thoroughly. She had not the slightest idea
of putting herself out too much with regard to
Evelyn, but at the same time she knew that Evelyn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
would be very cross and disagreeable if she had not
her comforts; accordingly, the fire burned clear
and bright, and there were preparations for the
young girl’s favorite meal of chocolate and biscuits
already going on.
</p>
<p>
“Oh dear!” said Evelyn, “I am tired; but we
have had quite a good time. Of course when the
Castle belongs to me I shall always keep it packed
with company. There is no fun in a big place like
this unless you have heaps of guests. Aunt Frances
was quite harmless to-night.”
</p>
<p>
“Harmless!” cried Jasper.
</p>
<p>
“Yes; that is the word. She took no notice of
me at all. I do not mind that. Of course she is
jealous, poor thing! And perhaps I can scarcely
wonder. But if she leaves me alone I will leave her
alone.”
</p>
<p>
“You are conceited, Evelyn,” said Jasper. “How
could that grand and stately lady be jealous of a
little girl like yourself?”
</p>
<p>
“I think she is, all the same,” replied Evelyn.
“And, by the way, Jasper, I do not care for that
tone of yours. Why do you call me a little girl and
speak as though you had no respect for me?”
</p>
<p>
“I love you too well to respect you, darling,”
replied Jasper.
</p>
<p>
“Love me too well! But I thought people never
loved others unless they respected them.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, but they do,” answered Jasper, with a short
laugh. “How should I love you if that was not
the case?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
</p>
<p>
Evelyn grew red and a puzzled expression flitted
across her face.
</p>
<p>
“I should like my chocolate,” she said, sinking
into a chair by the fire. “Make it for me,
please.”
</p>
<p>
Jasper did so without any comment. It was long
past midnight; the little clock on the mantelpiece
pointed with its jeweled hands to twenty minutes
to one.
</p>
<p>
“I shall not get up early,” said Evelyn. “Aunt
Frances was annoyed at my not being down this
morning, but she will have to bear it. You will
get me a very nice breakfast, won’t you, dear old
Jasper? When I wake you will have things very
cozy, won’t you, Jas?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, darling; I’ll do what I can. By the way,
Evelyn, you ought not to have let that poor Miss
Sylvia come up here and go off by herself.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn pouted.
</p>
<p>
“I won’t be scolded,” she said. “You forget your
place, Jasper. If you go on like this it might really
be best for you to go.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I meant nothing,” said Jasper, in some
alarm; “only it did seem—you will forgive my
saying it—not too kind.”
</p>
<p>
“I like Sylvia,” said Evelyn; “she is handsome
and she says funny things. I mean to see a good
deal more of her. Now I am sleepy, so you may
help me to get into bed.”
</p>
<p>
The spoilt child slept in unconscious bliss, and
the next morning, awaking late, desired Jasper to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>
fetch her breakfast. Jasper rang the bell. After a
time a servant appeared.
</p>
<p>
“Will you send Miss Wynford’s breakfast up immediately?”
said Jasper.
</p>
<p>
The girl, a neat-looking housemaid, withdrew.
She tapped at the door again in a few minutes.
</p>
<p>
“If you please, Miss Jasper,” she said, “Lady
Frances’s orders are that Miss Evelyn is to get up
to breakfast.”
</p>
<p>
Jasper, with a slight smirk on her face, went into
Evelyn’s bedroom to retail this message. Evelyn’s
face turned the color of chalk with intense anger.
</p>
<p>
“Impertinent woman!” she murmured. “Go
down immediately yourself, Jasper, and bring me
up some breakfast. Go—do you hear? I will not
be ruled by Lady Frances.”
</p>
<p>
Jasper very unwillingly went down-stairs. She
returned in about ten minutes to inform Evelyn
that it was quite useless, that Lady Frances had
given most positive orders, and that there was not a
servant in the house who would dare to disobey
her.
</p>
<p>
“But you would dare,” said the angry child.
“Why did you not go into the larder and fetch the
things yourself?”
</p>
<p>
“The cook took care of that, Miss Evelyn; the
larder door was locked.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me!” said Evelyn; “and I am so hungry.”
She began to cry.
</p>
<p>
“Had you not better get up, Evelyn?” said the
maid. “The servants told me down-stairs that breakfast
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
would be served in the breakfast-room to-day
up to ten o’clock.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you think I am going to let her have the
victory over me?” said Evelyn. “No; I shall not
stir. I won’t go to meals at all if this sort of thing
goes on. Oh, I am cruelly treated! I am—I am!
And I am so desperately hungry! Is not there even
any chocolate left, Jasper?”
</p>
<p>
“I am sorry to say there is not, dear—you finished
it all, to the last drop, last night; and the tin with
the biscuits is empty also. There is nothing to eat
in this room. I am afraid you will have to hurry
and dress yourself—that is, if you want breakfast.”
</p>
<p>
“I won’t stir,” said Evelyn—“not if she comes to
drag me out of bed with cart-ropes.”
</p>
<p>
Jasper stood and stared at her young charge.
</p>
<p>
“You are very silly, Miss Evelyn,” she said.
“You will have to submit to her ladyship. You are
only a very young girl, and you will find that you
cannot fight against her.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn now covered her face with her handkerchief,
and her sobs became distressful.
</p>
<p>
“Come, dear, come!” said Jasper not unkindly;
“let me help you to get into your clothes.”
</p>
<p>
But Evelyn pushed her devoted maid away with
vigorous hands.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t touch me. I hate you!” she said.—“Oh
mothery, mothery, why did you die and leave me?
Oh, your own little Evelyn is so wretched!”
</p>
<p>
“Now, really, Miss Evelyn, I am angry with you.
You are a silly child! You can dress and go down-stairs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
and have as nice a breakfast as you please. I
heard them talking in the breakfast-room as I went
by. They were such a merry party!”
</p>
<p>
“Much they care for me!” said Evelyn.
</p>
<p>
“Well, they don’t naturally unless you go and
make yourself pleasant. But there, Miss Evelyn! if
you don’t get up, I cannot do without my breakfast,
so I am going down to the servants’ hall.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! could not you bring me up a little bit of
something, Jasper—even bread—even dry bread? I
don’t mind how stale it is, for I am quite desperately
hungry.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I’ll try if I can smuggle something,”
said Jasper; “but I do not believe I can, all the
same.”
</p>
<p>
The woman departed, anxious for her meal.
</p>
<p>
She came back in a little over half an hour, to
find Evelyn sitting up in bed, her eyes red from all
the tears she had shed, and her face pale.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” she said, “have you brought up anything?”
</p>
<p>
“Only hot water for your bath, my dear. I was
not allowed to go off even with a biscuit.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh dear! then I’ll die—I really shall. You
don’t know how weak I am! Aunt Frances will
have killed me! Oh, this is too awful!”
</p>
<p>
“You had better get up now, Miss Evelyn. You
are very fat and stout, my dear, and missing one
meal will not kill you, so don’t think it.”
</p>
<p>
“I know what I do think, Jasper, and that is that
you are horrid!” said Evelyn.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>
</p>
<p>
But she had scarcely uttered the words before
there came a low but very distinct knock on the door.
Jasper went to open it. Evelyn’s heart began to
beat with a mixture of alarm and triumph. Of
course this was some one coming with her breakfast.
Or could it be, possibly—— But no; even Lady
Frances would not go so far as to come to gloat over
her victim’s miseries.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, it was Lady Frances. She walked
boldly into the room.
</p>
<p>
“You can go, Jasper,” she said. “I have something
I wish to say to Miss Wynford.”
</p>
<p>
Jasper, in considerable annoyance, withdrew, but
returned after a minute and placed her ear to the
keyhole. Lady Frances did not greatly mind, however,
whether she was overheard or not.
</p>
<p>
“Get up, Evelyn,” she said. “Get up at once and
dress yourself.”
</p>
<p>
“I—I don’t want to get up,” murmured Evelyn.
</p>
<p>
“Come! I am waiting.”
</p>
<p>
Lady Frances sat down on a chair. Her eyes
traveled slowly round the disorderly room; displeasure
grew greater in her face.
</p>
<p>
“Get up, my dear—get up,” she said. “I am
waiting.”
</p>
<p>
“But I don’t want to.”
</p>
<p>
“I am afraid your wanting to or not wanting to
makes little or no difference, Evelyn. I stay here
until you get up. You need not hurry yourself; I
will give you until lunch-time if necessary, but until
you get up I stay here.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
</p>
<p>
“And if,” said Evelyn in a tremulous voice, “I
don’t get up until after lunch?”
</p>
<p>
“Then you do without food; you have nothing to
eat until you get up. Now, do not let us discuss
this point any longer; I want to be busy over my
accounts.”
</p>
<p>
Lady Frances drew a small table towards her,
took a note-book and a Letts’s Diary from a bag at
her side, and became absorbed in the irritating task
of counting up petty expenses. Lady Frances no
more looked at Evelyn than if she had not existed.
The angry little girl in the bed even ventured to make
faces in the direction of the tyrannical lady; but the
tyrannical lady saw nothing. Jasper outside the
door found it no longer interesting to press her ear
to the keyhole. She retired in some trepidation,
and presently made herself busy in Evelyn’s boudoir.
For half an hour the conflict went on; then, as
might be expected, Evelyn gingerly and with intense
dislike put one foot out of bed.
</p>
<p>
Lady Frances saw nothing. She was now murmuring
softly to herself. She had long—very long—accounts
to add up.
</p>
<p>
Evelyn drew the foot back again.
</p>
<p>
“Nasty, horrid, horrid thing!” she said to herself.
“She shall not have the victory. But, oh, I am so
hungry!” was her next thought; “and she does
mean to conquer me. Oh, if only mothery were
alive!”
</p>
<p>
At the thought of her mother Evelyn burst into
loud sobs. Surely these would draw pity from that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
heart of stone! Not at all. Lady Frances went
calmly on with her occupation.
</p>
<p>
Finally, Evelyn did get up. She was not accustomed
to dressing herself, and she did so very badly.
Lady Frances did not take the slightest notice. In
about half an hour the untidy toilet was complete.
Evelyn had once more donned her crimson velvet
dress.
</p>
<p>
“I am ready,” she said then, and she came up to
Lady Frances’s side.
</p>
<p>
Lady Frances dropped her pencil, raised her eyes,
and fixed them on Evelyn’s face.
</p>
<p>
“Where do you keep your dresses?” she said.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know. Jasper knows.”
</p>
<p>
“Is Jasper in the next room?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“Go and fetch her.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn obeyed. She imagined her head was
giddy and that her legs were too weak to enable
her to walk steadily.
</p>
<p>
“Jasper, come,” she said in a tremulous voice.
</p>
<p>
“Poor darling! Poor pet!” muttered Jasper in
an injudicious undertone to her afflicted charge.
</p>
<p>
Lady Frances was now standing up.
</p>
<p>
“Come here, Jasper,” she said. “In which wardrobe
do you keep Miss Wynford’s dresses?”
</p>
<p>
“In this one, madam.”
</p>
<p>
“Open it and let me see.”
</p>
<p>
The maid obeyed. Lady Frances went to the
wardrobe and felt amongst skirts of different colors,
different materials, and different degrees of respectability.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
Without exception they were all unsuitable;
but presently she chose the least objectionable, an
ugly drab frieze, and lifting it herself from its hook,
laid it on the bed.
</p>
<p>
“Is there a bodice for this dress?” she asked of
the maid.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, madam. Miss Evelyn used to wear that on
the ranch. She has outgrown it rather.”
</p>
<p>
“Put it on your young mistress and let me see
her.”
</p>
<p>
“I won’t wear that horrid thing!” said Evelyn.
</p>
<p>
“You will wear what I choose.”
</p>
<p>
Again Evelyn submitted. The dress was put on.
It was not becoming, but was at least quiet in
appearance.
</p>
<p>
“You will wear that to-day,” said her aunt. “I
will myself take you into town this afternoon to get
some suitable clothes.—Jasper, I wish Miss Evelyn’s
present wardrobe to be neatly packed in her
trunks.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, madam.”
</p>
<p>
“No, no, Aunt Frances; you cannot mean it,”
said Evelyn.
</p>
<p>
“My dear, I do.—Before you go, Jasper, I have
one thing to say. I am sorry, but I cannot help
myself. Your late mistress wished you to remain
with Miss Wynford. I grieve to say that you are
not the kind of person I should wish to have the
charge of her. I will myself get a suitable maid to
look after the young lady, and you can go this afternoon.
I will pay you well. I am sorry for this; it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
sounds cruel, but it is really cruel to be kind.—Now,
Evelyn, what is the matter?”
</p>
<p>
“Only I hate you! Oh, how I hate you!” said
Evelyn. “I wish mothery were alive that she might
fight you! Oh, you are a horrid woman! How I
hate you!”
</p>
<p>
“When you come to yourself, Evelyn, and you are
inclined to apologize for your intemperate words,
you can come down-stairs, where your belated breakfast
awaits you.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span><a name='chX' id='chX'></a>CHAPTER X.—JASPER WAS TO GO.</h2>
<p>
What will not hunger—real, healthy hunger—effect?
Lady Frances, after her last words, swept
out of the room; and Jasper, her bosom heaving, her
black eyes flashing angry fire, looked full at her little
charge. What would Evelyn do now? The spoilt
child, who could scarcely brook the smallest contradiction,
who had declined to get up even to breakfast,
to do without Jasper! To allow her friend
Jasper to be torn from her arms—Jasper, who had
been her mother’s dearest companion, who had sworn
to that mother that she would not leave Evelyn
come what might, that she would protect her against
the tyrant aunt and the tyrant uncle, that if necessary
she would fight for her with the power which the
law bestows! Oh, what an awful moment had arrived!
Jasper was to go. What would Evelyn do
now?
</p>
<p>
Evelyn’s first impulse had been all that was satisfactory.
Her fury had burst forth in wild, indignant
words. But now, when the child and the maid found
themselves alone, Jasper waited in expectancy which
was almost certainty. Evelyn would not submit to
this? She and her charge would leave Castle Wynford
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
together that very day. If they were eventually
parted, the law should part them.
</p>
<p>
Still Evelyn was silent.
</p>
<p>
“Oh Eve—my dear Miss Evelyn—my treasure!”
said the afflicted woman.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Jasper?” said Evelyn then. “It is an
awful nuisance.”
</p>
<p>
“A nuisance! Is that all you have got to say?”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn rubbed her eyes.
</p>
<p>
“I won’t submit, of course,” she said. “No, I
won’t submit for a minute. But, Jasper, I must
have some breakfast; I am too hungry for anything.
Perhaps you had better take all my darling, lovely
clothes; and if you have to go, Jasper, I’ll—I’ll
never forget you; but I’ll talk to you more about it
when I have had something to eat.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn turned and left the room. She was in
an ugly dress, beyond doubt, but in her neat black
shoes and stockings, and with her fair hair tied back
according to Lady Frances’s directions, she looked
rather more presentable than she had done the previous
day. She entered the breakfast-room. The
remains of a meal still lay upon the table. Evelyn
looked impatiently round. Surely some one ought
to appear—a servant at the very least! Hot tea she
required, hot coffee, dishes nicely cooked and tempting
and fresh. The little girl went to the bell and
rang it. A footman appeared.
</p>
<p>
“Get my breakfast immediately,” said Evelyn.
</p>
<p>
The man withdrew, endeavoring to hide a smile.
Evelyn’s conduct in daring to defy Lady Frances
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
had been the amusement of the servants’ hall that
morning. The man went to the kitchen premises
now with the announcement that “miss” had come
to her senses.
</p>
<p>
“She is as white as a sheet, and looks as mad as a
hatter,” said the man; “but her spirit ain’t broke.
My word! she ’ave got a will of her own. ‘My
breakfast, immediate,’ says she, as though she were
the lady of the manor.”
</p>
<p>
“Which she will be some day,” said cook; “and
I ’ates to think of it. Our beautiful Miss Audrey supplanted
by the like of her. There, Johnson! my
missus said that Miss Wynford was to have quite a
plain breakfast, so take it up—do.”
</p>
<p>
Toast, fresh tea, and one solitary new-laid egg were
placed on a tray and brought up to the breakfast-room.
</p>
<p>
Evelyn sat down without a word, poured herself
out some tea, ate every crumb of toast, finished her
egg, and felt refreshed. She had just concluded her
meal when Audrey, accompanied by Arthur Jervice,
ran into the room.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I say, Evelyn,” cried Audrey, “you are the
very person that we want. We are getting up
charades for to-night; will you join us?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, do, please,” said Arthur. “And we are
most anxious that Sylvia should join too.”
</p>
<p>
“I wish I knew her address,” said Audrey. “She
is such a mystery! Mother is rather disturbed about
her. I am afraid, Arthur, we cannot have her to-night;
we must manage without.—But will you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
join us, Evelyn? Do you know anything about
acting?”
</p>
<p>
“I have never acted, but I have seen plays,” said
Evelyn. “I am sure I can manage all right. I’ll
do my best if you will give me a big part. I won’t
take a little part, for it would not be suitable.”
</p>
<p>
Audrey colored and laughed.
</p>
<p>
“Well, come, anyway, and we will do our best for
you,” she said. “Have you finished your breakfast?
The rest of us are in my schoolroom. You have not
been introduced to it yet. Come if you are ready;
we are all waiting.”
</p>
<p>
After her miserable morning, Evelyn considered
this an agreeable change. She had intended to go
up-stairs to comfort Jasper, but really and truly
Jasper must wait. She accordingly went with her
cousin, and was welcomed by all the children, who
pitied her and wanted to make her as much at home
as possible. A couple of charades were discussed,
and Evelyn was thoroughly satisfied with the <em>rôle</em>
assigned her. She was a clever child enough, and
had some powers of mimicry. As the different arrangements
were being made she suddenly remembered
something, and uttered a cry.
</p>
<p>
“Oh dear!” she said—“oh dear! What a pity!”
</p>
<p>
“What is it now, Evelyn?” asked her cousin.
</p>
<p>
“Why, your mother is so—I suppose I ought not
to say it—your mother—I—— There! I must
not say that either. Your mother——”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, for goodness’ sake speak out!” said Audrey.
“What has poor, dear mother done?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>
</p>
<p>
“She is sending Jasper away; she is—she is. Oh,
can I bear it? Don’t you think it is awful of her?”
</p>
<p>
“I am sorry for you,” said Audrey.
</p>
<p>
“Jasper would be so useful,” continued Evelyn.
“She is such a splendid actress; she could help me
tremendously. I do wish she could stay even till
to-morrow. Cannot you ask Aunt Frances—cannot
you, Audrey? I wish you would.”
</p>
<p>
“I must not, Evelyn; mother cannot brook interference.
She would not dream of altering her plans
just for a play.—Well,” she added, looking round at
the rest of her guests, “I think we have arranged
everything now; we must meet here not later than
three o’clock for rehearsal. Who would like to go
out?” she added. “The morning is lovely.”
</p>
<p>
The boys and girls picked up hats and cloaks and
ran out immediately into the grounds. Evelyn took
the first covering she could find, and joined the
others.
</p>
<p>
“They ought to consult me more,” she said to
herself. “I see there is no help for it; I must live
here for a bit and put Audrey down—that at least
is due to me. But when next there are people here
I shall be arranging the charades, and I shall invite
them to go out into the grounds. It is a great
bother about Jasper; but there! she must bear it,
poor dear. She will be all right when I tell her
that I will get her back when the Castle belongs
to me.”
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Arthur, remembering his promise to
Sylvia, ran away from where the others were standing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
The boy ran fast, hoping to see Sylvia. He
had taken a great fancy to her bright, dark eyes and
her vivacious ways.
</p>
<p>
“She promised to meet me,” he said to himself.
“She is certain to keep her word.”
</p>
<p>
By and by he uttered a loud “Hullo!” and a slim
young figure, in a shabby crimson cloak, turned and
came towards him.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, it is you, Arthur!” said Sylvia. “Well, and
how are they all?”
</p>
<p>
“Quite well,” replied the boy. “We are going to
have charades to-night, and I am to be the doctor in
one. It is rather a difficult part, and I hope I shall
do it right. I never played in a charade before.
That little monkey Evelyn is to be the patient. I
do hope she will behave properly and not spoil everything.
She is such an extraordinary child! And of
course she ought to have had quite one of the most
unimportant parts, but she would not hear of it. I
wish you were going to play in the charade, Sylvia.”
</p>
<p>
“I have often played in charades,” said Sylvia,
with a quick sigh.
</p>
<p>
“Have you? How strange! You seem to have
done everything.”
</p>
<p>
“I have done most things that girls of my age
have done.”
</p>
<p>
Arthur looked at her with curiosity. There was—he
could not help noticing it, and he blushed very
vividly as he did see—a very roughly executed patch
on the side of her shoe. On the other shoe, too, the
toes were worn white. They were shabby shoes, although
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
the little feet they encased were neat enough,
with high insteps and narrow, tapering toes. Sylvia
knew quite well what was passing in Arthur’s mind.
After a moment she spoke.
</p>
<p>
“You wonder why I look poor,” she said. “Sometimes,
Arthur, appearances deceive. I am not poor.
It is my pleasure to wear very simple clothes, and to
eat very plain food, and——”
</p>
<p>
“Not pleasure!” said Arthur. “You don’t look
as if it were your pleasure. Why, Sylvia, I do believe
you are hungry now!”
</p>
<p>
Poor Sylvia was groaning inwardly, so keen was
her hunger.
</p>
<p>
“And I am as peckish as I can be,” said the boy,
a rapid thought flashing through his mind. “The
village is only a quarter of a mile from here, and I
know there are tuck-shops. Why should we not go
and have a lark all by ourselves? Who’s to know,
and who’s to care? Will you come, Sylvia?”
</p>
<p>
“No, I cannot,” replied Sylvia; “it is impossible.
Thank you very much indeed, Arthur. I am so glad
to have seen you! I must go home, however, in a
minute or two. I was out all day yesterday, and
there is a great deal to be done.”
</p>
<p>
“But may I not come with you? Cannot I help
you?”
</p>
<p>
“No, thank you; indeed I could not possibly have
you. It is very good of you to offer, but I cannot
have you, and I must not tell you why.”
</p>
<p>
“You do look so sad! Are you sure you cannot
join the charades to-night?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>
</p>
<p>
“Sure—certain,” said Sylvia, with a little gasp.
“And I am not sad,” she added; “there never was
any one more merry. Listen to me now; I am
going to laugh the echoes up.”
</p>
<p>
They were standing where a defile of rocks
stretched away to their left. The stream ran
straight between the narrow opening. The girl
slightly changed her position, raised her hand, and
called out a clear “Hullo!” It was echoed back
from many points, growing fainter and fainter as it
died away.
</p>
<p>
“And now you say I am not merry!” she exclaimed.
“Listen.”
</p>
<p>
She laughed a ringing laugh. There never was
anything more musical than the way that laughter
was taken up, as if there were a thousand sprites
laughing too. Sylvia turned her white face and
looked full at Arthur.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I am such a merry girl!” she said, “and
such a glad one! and such a thankful one! And I
am rich—not poor—but I like simple things. Good-by,
Arthur, for the present.”
</p>
<p>
“I will come and see you again. You are quite
wonderful!” he said. “I wish mother knew you.
And I wish my sister Moss were here; I wish she
knew you.”
</p>
<p>
“Moss! What a curious name!” said Sylvia.
</p>
<p>
“We have always called her that. She is just
like moss, so soft and yet so springy; so comfortable,
and yet you dare not take too much liberty
with her. She is fragile, too, and mother had to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
take great care of her. I should like you to see
her; she would——”
</p>
<p>
“What would she do?” asked Sylvia.
</p>
<p>
“She would understand you; she would draw part
at least of the trouble away.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! don’t, Arthur—don’t, don’t read me like
that,” said the girl.
</p>
<p>
The tears just dimmed her eyes. She dashed
them away, laughed again merrily, and the next
moment had turned the corner and was lost to view.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span><a name='chXI' id='chXI'></a>CHAPTER XI.—“I CANNOT ALTER MY PLANS.”</h2>
<p>
Immediately after lunch Lady Frances beckoned
Evelyn to her side.
</p>
<p>
“Go up-stairs and ask Jasper to dress you,” she
said. “The carriage will be round in a few
minutes.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn wanted to expostulate. She looked full
at Audrey. Surely Audrey would protect her from
the terrible infliction of a long drive alone with
Lady Frances! Audrey did catch Evelyn’s beseeching
glance; she took a step forward.
</p>
<p>
“Do you particularly want Evelyn this afternoon,
mother?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, dear; if I did not want her I should not
ask her to come with me.”
</p>
<p>
Lady Frances’s words were very impressive;
Audrey stood silent.
</p>
<p>
“Please tell her—please tell her!” interrupted
Evelyn in a voice tremulous with passion.
</p>
<p>
“We are going to have charades to-night, mother,
and Evelyn’s part is somewhat important; we are
all to rehearse in the schoolroom at three o’clock.”
</p>
<p>
“And my part is very important,” interrupted
Evelyn again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
</p>
<p>
“I am sorry,” said Lady Frances, “but Evelyn
must come with me. Is there no one else to take
the part, Audrey?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, mother; Sophie could do it. She has a
very small part, and she is a good actress, and
Evelyn could easily do Sophie’s part; but, all the
same, it will disappoint Eve.”
</p>
<p>
“I am sorry for that,” said Lady Frances; “but
I cannot alter my plans. Give Sophie the part that
Evelyn would have taken; Evelyn can take her
part.—You will have plenty of time, Evelyn, when
you return to coach for the small part.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, you will, Evelyn; but I am sorry, all the
same,” said Audrey, and she turned away.
</p>
<p>
Evelyn’s lips trembled. She stood motionless;
then she slowly revolved round, intending to fire
some very angry words into Lady Frances’s face;
but, lo and behold! there was no Lady Frances
there. She had gone up-stairs while Evelyn was
lost in thought.
</p>
<p>
Very quietly the little girl went up to her own
room. Jasper, her eyes almost swollen out of her
head with crying, was there to wait on her.
</p>
<p>
“I have been packing up, Miss Evelyn,” she said.
“I am to go this afternoon. Her ladyship has made
all arrangements, and a cab is to come from the
‘Green Man’ in the village to fetch me and my
luggage at half-past three. It is almost past belief,
Miss Eve, that you and me should be parted like
this.”
</p>
<p>
“You look horrid, Jasper, when you cry so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>
hard!” said Evelyn. “Oh, of course I am awfully
sorry; I do not know how I shall live without you.”
</p>
<p>
“You will miss me a good bit,” said the woman.
“I am surprised, though, that you should take it
as you do. If you raised your voice and started the
whole place in an uproar you would be bound to
have your own way. But as it is, you are mum as
you please; never a word out of you either of sorrow
or anything else, but off you go larking with
those children and forgetting the one who has made
you, mended you, and done everything on earth for
you since long before your mother died.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t remind me of mothery now,” said the girl,
and her lips trembled; then she added in a changed
voice: “I cannot help it, Jasper. I have been fighting
ever since I came here, and I want to fight—oh,
most badly, most desperately!—but somehow the
courage has gone out of me. I am ever so sorry
for you, Jasper, but I cannot help myself; I really
cannot.”
</p>
<p>
Jasper was silent. After a time she said slowly:
</p>
<p>
“And your mother wrote a letter on her deathbed
asking Lady Frances to let me stay with you
whatever happened.”
</p>
<p>
“I know,” said Evelyn. “It is awful of her; it
really is.”
</p>
<p>
“And do you think,” continued the woman, “I
am going to submit?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, you must, Jasper. You cannot stay if
they do not wish for you. And you have got all
your wages, have you not?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
</p>
<p>
“I have, my dear; I have. Yes,” continued the
woman; “she thinks, of course, that I am satisfied,
and that I am going as mum as a mouse and as
quiet as the grave, but she is fine and mistook; I
ain’t doing nothing of the sort. Go I must, but
not far. I have a plan in my head. It may come to
nothing; but if it does come to something, as I hope
to goodness it will, then you will hear of me again,
my pet, and I won’t be far off to protect you if the
time should come that you need me. And now,
what do you want of me, my little lamb, for your
face is piteous to see?”
</p>
<p>
“I am a miserable girl,” said Evelyn. “I could
cry for hours, but there is no time. Dress me, then,
for the last time, Jasper. Oh, Jasper darling, I am
fond of you!”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn’s stoical, hard sort of nature seemed to
give way at this juncture; she flung her arms round
her maid’s neck and kissed her many times passionately.
The woman kissed her, too, in a hungry sort
of way.
</p>
<p>
“You are really not going far away, Jasper?”
said Evelyn when, dressed in her coat and hat, she
was ready to start.
</p>
<p>
“My plans are laid but not made yet,” said the
woman. “You will hear from me likely to-morrow,
my love. And now, good-by. I have packed all
your things in the trunks they came in, and the
wardrobe is empty. Oh, my pet, my pet, good-by!
Who will look after you to-night, and who will sleep
in the little white bed alongside of you? Oh, my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
darling, the spirit of your Jasper is broke, that it
is!”
</p>
<p>
“Evelyn!” called her aunt, who was passing her
room at that moment, “the carriage is at the door.
Come at once.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn ran down-stairs. She wore a showy,
unsuitable hat and a showy, unsuitable jacket. She
got quickly into the carriage, and flopped down by
the side of the stately Lady Frances.
</p>
<p>
Lady Frances was a very judicious woman in her
way. She reprimanded whenever in her opinion
it was necessary to reprimand, but she never nagged.
It needed but a glance to show her that Evelyn
required to be educated in every form of good-breeding,
and that education the good woman fully intended
to take in hand without a moment’s delay,
but she did not intend to find fault moment by
moment. She said nothing, therefore, either in praise
or blame to the small, awkward, conceited little girl
by her side; but she gave orders to stop at Simpson’s
in the High Street, and the carriage started briskly
forward. Wynford Castle was within half a mile
of the village which was called after it, and five
miles away from a large and very important
cathedral town—the cathedral town of Easterly.
During the drive Lady Frances chatted in the sort
of tone she would use to a small girl, and Evelyn
gave short and sulky replies. Finding that her conversation
was not interesting to her small guest, the
good lady became silent and wrapped up in her own
thoughts. Presently they arrived at Simpson’s, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
there the lady and the child got out and entered the
shop. Evelyn was absolutely bewildered by the
amount of things which her aunt ordered for her.
It is true that she had had, as Jasper expressed it,
quite a small trousseau when in Paris; but during
her mother’s lifetime her dresses had come to her
slowly and with long intervals between. Mrs.
Wynford had been a showy but by no means a good
dresser; she loved the gayest, most bizarre colors,
and she delighted in adorning her child with bits of
feathers, scraps of shabby lace, beads, and such-like
decorations. After her mother’s death, when Evelyn,
considered herself rich, she and Jasper purchased
the same sort of things, only using better materials.
Thus the thin silk was exchanged for thick silk,
cotton-back satin for the real article, velveteen for
velvet, cheap lace for real lace, and the gaily colored
beads for gold chains and strings of pearls. Nothing
in Evelyn’s opinion and nothing in Jasper’s opinion
could be more exquisitely beautiful than the toilet
which Evelyn brought to Castle Wynford; but Lady
Frances evidently thought otherwise. She ordered
a dark-blue serge, with a jacket to match, to be put
in hand immediately for the little girl; she bought
a dark-gray dress, ready made, which was to be sent
home that same evening. She got a neat black hat
to wear with the dress, and a thick black pilot-cloth
jacket to cover the small person of the heiress. As
to her evening-dresses, she chose them of fine, soft
white silk and fine, soft muslin; and then, having
added a large store of underclothing, all of the best
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
quality, and one or two pale-pink and pale-blue evening-frocks,
all severely plain, she got once more into
her carriage, and, accompanied by Evelyn, drove
home. On the seat in front of the pair reposed a
box which contained a very simple white muslin
frock for Evelyn to wear that evening.
</p>
<p>
“I suppose Jasper will have gone when I get
back?” said the little girl to Lady Frances.
</p>
<p>
“Certainly,” said Lady Frances. “I ordered her
to be out of the house by half-past three; it is now
past five o’clock.”
</p>
<p>
“What am I to do for a maid?”
</p>
<p>
“My servant Read shall wait on you to-night and
every evening and morning until our guests have
gone; then Audrey’s maid Louisa will attend on
you.”
</p>
<p>
“But I want a maid all to myself.”
</p>
<p>
“You cannot have one. Louisa will give you
what assistance is necessary. I presume you do not
want to be absolutely dependent; you would like
to be able to do things for yourself.”
</p>
<p>
“In mother’s time I did everything for myself,
but now it is different. I am a very, very rich girl
now.”
</p>
<p>
Lady Frances was silent when Evelyn made this
remark.
</p>
<p>
“I am rich, am I not, Aunt Frances?” said the
little heiress almost timidly.
</p>
<p>
“I cannot see where the riches come in, Evelyn.
At the present moment you depend on your uncle
for every penny that is spent upon you.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
</p>
<p>
“But I am the heiress!”
</p>
<p>
“Let the future take care of itself. You are a
little girl—small, insignificant, and ignorant. You
require to be trained and looked after, and to have
your character moulded, and for all these things
you depend on the kindness of your relations. The
fact is this, Evelyn: at present you have not the
slightest idea of your true position. When you find
your level I shall have hopes of you—not before.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn leant back hopelessly in the carriage and
began to sob. After a time she said:
</p>
<p>
“I wish you would let me keep Jasper.”
</p>
<p>
Lady Frances was silent.
</p>
<p>
“Why won’t you let me keep Jasper?”
</p>
<p>
“I do not consider it good for you.”
</p>
<p>
“But mothery asked you to.”
</p>
<p>
“It gives me pain, Evelyn, under the circumstances
to refuse your mother’s request; but I have consulted
your uncle, and we both feel that the steps I have
taken are the only ones to take.”
</p>
<p>
“Who will sleep in my room to-night?”
</p>
<p>
“Are you such a baby as to need anybody?”
</p>
<p>
“I never slept alone in my life. I am quite terrified.
I suppose your big, ancient house is haunted?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, what a silly child you are! Very well, for
a night or two I will humor you, and Read shall
sleep in the room; but now clearly understand I
allow no bedroom suppers and no gossip—but Read
will see to that. Now, make up your mind to be
happy and contented—in short, to submit to the life
which Providence has ordered for you. Think first
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>
of others and last of yourself and you may be happy.
Consult Audrey and Miss Sinclair and you will gain
wisdom. Obey me whether you like it or not, or you
will certainly be a very wretched girl. Ah! and
here we are. You would like to go to the schoolroom;
they are having tea there, I believe. Run off,
dear; that will do for the present.”
</p>
<p>
When Evelyn reached the schoolroom she found
a busy and animated group all seated about in different
parts of it. They were eagerly discussing the
charade, and when Evelyn arrived she was welcomed.
</p>
<p>
“I am ever so sorry, Evelyn,” said Audrey, “that
you cannot have the part you wanted; but we mean
to get up some other charades later on in the week,
and then you shall help us and have a very good
part. You do not mind our arrangement for to-night,
do you?”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn replied somewhat sulkily. Audrey determined
to take no notice. She sat down by her little
cousin, told Sophie to fetch some hot tea, and soon
coaxed Evelyn into a fairly good-humor. The small
part she was to undertake was read over to her, and
she was obliged to get certain words by heart. She
had little or no idea of acting, but there was a certain
calm assurance about her which would carry her
through many difficulties. The children, incited by
Audrey’s example, were determined to pet her and
make the best of her; and when she did leave the
schoolroom she felt almost as happy and important
as she thought she ought to be.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
</p>
<p>
“What a horrid girl she is!” said Sophie as soon
as the door had closed behind Evelyn.
</p>
<p>
“I wish you would not say that,” remarked Audrey;
and a look of distress visited her pretty face.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, we do not mind for ourselves,” remarked
Juliet; “it is on your account, Audrey. You know
what great friends we have always been, and now
to have you associated every day, and all day long
with a girl of that sort—it really seems almost past
bearing.”
</p>
<p>
“I shall get used to it,” said Audrey. “And remember
that I pity her, and am sorry—very sorry—for
her. I dare say we shall win her over by being
kind.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Henrietta, rising as she spoke and
slowly crossing the room, “I have promised to be
civil to her for your sake for a day or two, but I vow
it will not last long if she gives herself such ridiculous
airs. The idea of her ever having a place like
this!”
</p>
<p>
She said the last words below her breath, and
Audrey did not hear them. Presently her mother
called her, and the young girl ran off. The others
looked at each other.
</p>
<p>
“Well, Arthur, and what is filling your mind?”
said his sister Henrietta, looking into the face of the
handsome boy.
</p>
<p>
“I am thinking of Sylvia,” he answered. “I wish
she were here instead of Evelyn. Don’t you like
her very much, Hennie? Don’t you think she is a
very handsome and very interesting girl?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
</p>
<p>
“I hardly spoke to her,” replied Henrietta. “I
saw you were taken with her.”
</p>
<p>
“She was mysterious; that is one reason why
I like her,” he replied. Then he added abruptly:
“I wish you would make friends with her, Henrietta.
I wish you, and Juliet too, could be specially kind
to her; she looks so very sad.”
</p>
<p>
“I never saw a merrier girl,” was Juliet’s reply.
“But then, I don’t see people with your eyes; you
are always a good one at guessing people’s secrets.”
</p>
<p>
“I take after Moss in that,” he replied.
</p>
<p>
“There never was any one like her,” said Juliet.
“Well, I am going to dress now. I hope the charade
will go off well. What a blessing Lady Frances
came to the rescue and delivered us from Evelyn’s
spoiling everything by taking a good part!”
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Evelyn had gone up to her room. It
was neat and in perfect order once more. Jasper’s
brief reign had passed and left no sign. The fire
burned brightly on the carefully swept-up hearth;
the electric light made the room bright as day. A
neat, grave-looking woman was standing by the fire,
and when Evelyn appeared she came forward to
meet her.
</p>
<p>
“My name is Mrs. Read,” she said. “I am my
mistress’s own special maid, but she has asked me to
see to your toilet this evening, Miss Wynford; and
this, I understand, is the dress her ladyship wishes
you to wear.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn pouted; then she tossed off her hat and
looked full up at Read. Her lips quivered, and a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>
troubled, pathetic light for the first time filled her
brown eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Where is Jasper?” she asked abruptly.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Jasper has left, my dear young lady.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I hate you, and I don’t want you to dress
me. You can go away,” said Evelyn.
</p>
<p>
“I am sorry, Miss Wynford, but her ladyship’s
orders are that I am to attend to your wardrobe.
Perhaps you will allow me to do your hair and put
on your dress at once, as her ladyship wants me to
go to her a little later.”
</p>
<p>
“You will do nothing of the kind. I will dress
myself now that Jasper has gone.”
</p>
<p>
“And a good thing too, miss. Young ladies ought
always to make themselves useful. The more you
know, the better off you will be; that is my opinion.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn looked full up at Read. Read had a
kindly face, calm blue eyes, a firm, imperturbable
sort of mouth. She wore her hair very neatly
banded on each side of her head. Her dress was
perfectly immaculate. There was nothing out of
place; she looked, in short, like the very soul of order.
</p>
<p>
“Do you know who I am?” was Evelyn’s remark.
</p>
<p>
“Certainly I do, Miss Wynford.”
</p>
<p>
“Please tell me.”
</p>
<p>
The glimmer of a smile flitted across Read’s calm
mouth.
</p>
<p>
“You are a young lady from Tasmania, niece to
the Squire, and you have come over here to be educated
with Miss Audrey—bless her!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
</p>
<p>
“Is that all you know!” said Evelyn. “Then I
will tell you more. There will come a day when
your Miss Audrey will have nothing to do with the
Castle, and when I shall have everything to do with
it. I am to be mistress here any day, whenever my
uncle dies.”
</p>
<p>
“My dear Miss Wynford, don’t speak like that!
The Squire is safe to live, Providence permitting, for
many a long year.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn sat down again.
</p>
<p>
“I think my aunt, Lady Frances, one of the
cruellest women in the world,” she continued. “Now
you know what I think, and you can tell her, you
nasty cross-patch. You can go away and tell her at
once. I longed to say so to her face when I was
out driving to-day, but she has got the upper hand
of me, although she is not going to keep it. I don’t
want you to help me; I hate you nearly as much as
I hate her!”
</p>
<p>
Read looked as though she did not hear a single
remark that Evelyn made. She crossed the room,
and presently returned with a can of hot water and
poured some into a basin.
</p>
<p>
“Now, miss,” she said, “if you will wash your face
and hands, I will arrange your hair.”
</p>
<p>
There was something in her tone which reduced
Evelyn to silence.
</p>
<p>
“Did you not hear what I said?” she remarked
after a minute.
</p>
<p>
“No, miss; it may be more truthful to say I did
not. When young ladies talk silly, naughty words
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
I have a ’abit of shutting up my ears; so it ain’t no
manner of use to talk on to me, miss, for I don’t
hear, and I won’t hear, and that is flat. If you will
come now, like a good little lady, and allow yourself
to be dressed, I have a bit of a surprise for you; but
you will not know about it before your toilet is
complete.”
</p>
<p>
“A bit of a surprise!” said Evelyn, who was intensely
curious. “What in the world can it be?”
</p>
<p>
“I will tell you when you are dressed, miss; and
I must ask you to hurry, for my mistress is waiting
for me.”
</p>
<p>
If Evelyn had one overweening failing more than
another, it was inordinate curiosity. She rose, therefore,
and submitted with a very bad grace to Read’s
manipulations. Her face and hands were washed,
and Read proceeded to brush out the scanty flaxen
locks.
</p>
<p>
“Are you not going to pile my hair on the top of
my head?” asked the little girl.
</p>
<p>
“Oh dear, no, Miss Wynford; that ain’t at all
the way little ladies of your age wear their hair.”
</p>
<p>
“I always wore it like that when I was in Tasmania
with mothery!”
</p>
<p>
“Tasmania is not England, miss. It would not
suit her ladyship for you to wear your hair so.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I won’t wear it any other way.”
</p>
<p>
“As you please, miss. I can put on your dress,
and you can arrange your hair yourself, but I won’t
give you what will be a bit of a surprise to you.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, do it as you please,” said Evelyn.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
</p>
<p>
Her hair, very pretty in itself, although far too thin
to make much show, was accordingly arranged in
childish fashion; and when Evelyn presently found
herself arrayed in her high-bodied and long-sleeved
white muslin dress, with white silk stockings and
little silk shoes to match, and a white sash round her
waist, she gazed at herself in the glass in puzzled
wonder.
</p>
<p>
Read stood for a moment watching her face.
</p>
<p>
“I am pretty, am I not?” said Evelyn, turning
and looking full at her maid.
</p>
<p>
“It is best not to think of looks, and it is downright
sinful to talk of them,” was Read’s somewhat
severe answer.
</p>
<p>
Evelyn’s eyes twinkled.
</p>
<p>
“I feel like a very good, pretty little girl,” she
said. “Last night I was a charming grown-up
young lady. Very soon again I shall be a charming
grown-up young lady, and whether Aunt Frances
likes it or not, I shall be much, much better-looking
than Audrey. Now, please, I have been good, and
I want what you said you had for me.”
</p>
<p>
“It is a letter from Jasper,” replied Read. “She
told me I was to give it to you. Now, please, miss,
don’t make yourself untidy. You look very nice
and suitable. When the gong rings you can go down-stairs,
or sooner if your fancy takes you. I am going
off now to attend to my mistress.”
</p>
<p>
When alone, Evelyn tore open the letter which
Jasper had left for her. It was short, and ran as
follows:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
<span class='sc'>My darling, precious Lamb</span>,—The best friends
must part, but, oh, it is a black, black heart that
makes it necessary! My heart is bleeding to think
that you won’t have me to make your chocolate, and
to lie down in the little white bed by your side this
evening. Yes, it is bleeding, and bleeding badly, and
there will be no blessing on her who has tried to part
us. But, Miss Evelyn, my dear, don’t you fret, for
though I am away I do not mean to be far away,
and when you want me I will still be there. I have
a plan in my head, and I will let you know about
it when it is properly laid. No more at present,
but if you think of me every minute to-night, so
will I think of you, my dear little white Eve; and
don’t forget, darling, that whatever they may do
to you, the time will come when they will all, the
Squire excepted, be under your thumb.
</p>
<p style='text-align:right; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; margin-right:2em;;'>—Your loving</p>
<p style='text-align:right; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; margin-right:2em;;'>“<span class='sc'>Jasper</span>.”</p>
<p>
The morsel of content and satisfaction which
Evelyn had felt when she saw herself looking like a
nice, ordinary little girl, and when she had sat in the
schoolroom surrounded by all the gay young folks
of her cousin’s station in life, vanished completely as
she read Jasper’s injudicious words. Tears flowed
from her eyes; she clenched her hands. She danced
passionately about the room. She longed to tear
from her locks the white ribbons which Read had
arranged there; she longed to get into the white
satin dress which she had worn on the previous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
occasion; she longed to do anything on earth to defy
Lady Frances; but, alack and alas! what good were
longings when the means of yielding to them were
denied?—for all that precious and fascinating wardrobe
had been put into Evelyn’s traveling-trunks,
and those trunks had been conveyed from the blue-and-silver
bedroom. The little girl found that she
had to submit.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I do—I do,” she thought—“but only outwardly.
Oh, she will never break me in! Mothery
darling, she will never break me in. I am going to
be naughty always, always, because she is so cruel,
and because I hate her, and because she has parted
me from Jasper—your friend, my darling mothery,
your friend!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span><a name='chXII' id='chXII'></a>CHAPTER XII.—HUNGER.</h2>
<p>
When Jasper was conveyed from Wynford Castle
she drove to the “Green Man” in the village.
There she asked the landlady if she could give her a
small bedroom for the night. The landlady, a certain
Mrs. Simpson, was quite willing to oblige Miss
Jasper. She was accommodated with a bedroom,
and having seen her boxes deposited there, wandered
about the village. She took the bearings of the
place, which was small and unimportant, and altogether
devoted to the interests of the great folks at
Castle Wynford. Wynford village lived, indeed,
for the Castle; without the big house, as they
called it, the villagers would have little or no existence.
The village received its patronage from
the Squire and his family. Every house in the village
belonged to Squire Wynford. The inhabitants
regarded him as if he were their feudal lord. He
was kindly to all, sympathetic in sorrow, ready to
rejoice when bright moments visited each or any
of his tenants. Lady Frances was an admirable
almoner of the different charities which came from
the great house. There was not a poor woman in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
the length and breadth of Wynford village who was
not perfectly well aware that her ladyship knew
all about her, even to her little sins and her small
transgressions; all about her struggles as well as
her falls, her temptations as well as her moments
of victory. Lady Frances was loved and feared;
the Squire was loved and respected; Audrey was
loved in the sort of passionate way in which people
will regard the girl who always has been to them
more or less a little princess. Therefore now, as
Jasper walked slowly through the village with the
fading light falling all over her, she knew she
was a person of interest. Beyond doubt that was
the case; but although the villagers were interested
in her, and peeped outside their houses to watch
her (even the grocer, who did a roaring trade, and
took the tenor solo on Sunday in the church choir,
peered round his doorstep with the others), she
knew that she was favored with no admiring looks,
and that the villagers one and all were prepared to
fight her. That was indeed the case, for secrets
are no secrets where a great family are concerned,
and the villagers knew that Jasper had come over
from the other side of the world with the real heiress.
</p>
<p>
“A dowdy, ill-favored girl,” they said one to the
other; “but nevertheless, when the Squire—bless
him!—is gathered to his fathers, she will reign in
his stead, and sweet, darling, beautiful Miss Audrey
will be nowhere.”
</p>
<p>
They said this, repeating the disagreeable news
one to the other, and vowing each and all that they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>
would never care for the Australian girl, and never
give her a welcome.
</p>
<p>
As Jasper slowly walked she was conscious of the
feeling of hostility which surrounded her.
</p>
<p>
“It won’t do,” she said to herself. “I meant to
take up my abode at the ‘Green Man,’ and I meant
that no one in the place should turn me out, but I
do not believe I shall be able to continue there; and
yet, to go far away from my sweet little Eve is not
to be thought of. I have money of my own. Her
mother was a wise woman when she said to me,
‘Jasper, the time may come when you will need it;
and although it belongs to Eve, you must spend it
as you think best in her service.’
</p>
<p>
“It ain’t much,” thought Jasper to herself, “but
it is sixty pounds, and I have it in gold sovereigns,
scattered here and there in my big black trunk, and
I mean to spend it in watching over the dear angel
lamb. Mrs. Simpson of the ‘Green Man’ would
be the better of it, but she sha’n’t have much of
it—of that I am resolved.”
</p>
<p>
So Jasper presently left the village and began
strolling in the direction where the river Earn flows
between dark rocks until it loses itself in a narrow
stream among the peaceful hills. In that direction
lay The Priory, with its thick yew hedge and its
shut-in appearance.
</p>
<p>
As Jasper continued her walk she knew nothing
of the near neighborhood of The Priory, and no one
in all the world was farther from her thoughts
than the pretty, tall slip of a girl who lived there.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>
</p>
<p>
Now, it so happened that Sylvia was taking her
walks abroad also in the hour of dusk. It was one
of her peculiarities never to spend an hour that she
could help indoors. She had to sleep indoors, and
she had to take what food she could manage to secure
also under the roof which she so hated; but,
come rain or shine, storm or calm, every scrap of
the rest of her time was spent wandering about.
To the amount of fresh air which she breathed she
owed her health and a good deal of her beauty.
She was out now as usual, her big mastiff, Pilot,
bearing her company. She was never afraid where
she wandered with this protection, for Pilot was a
dog of sagacity, and would soon make matters too
hot for any one who meant harm to his young
mistress.
</p>
<p>
Sylvia walked slowly. She was thinking hard.
“What a delightful time she was having twenty-four
hours ago! What a good dinner she was about to
eat! How pleasant it was to wear Audrey’s pretty
dress! How delightful to dance in the hall and talk
to Arthur Jervice! She wondered what his sister
with the curious name was like. How beautiful his
face looked when he spoke of her!
</p>
<p>
“She must be lovely too,” thought Sylvia. “And
so restful! There is nothing so cool and comfortable
and peaceful as a mossy bank. I suppose she
is called Moss because she comforts people.”
</p>
<p>
Sylvia hurried a little. Presently she stood and
looked around her to be sure that no one was by.
She then deliberately tightened her belt.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>
</p>
<p>
“It makes me feel the pangs less,” she thought.
“Oh dear, how delightful, how happy those must be
who are never, never hungry! Sometimes I can
scarcely bear it; I almost feel that I could steal
something to have a big, big meal. What a lot I
ate last night, and how I longed to pocket even that
great hunch of bread which was placed near my
plate! But I did not dare. I thought my big
meal would keep off my hunger to-day, but I believe
it has made it worse than ever. I must have a
straight talk with father to-night. I must tell him
plainly that, however coarse the food, I must at
least have enough of it. Oh dear, I ache—I <em>ache</em> for
a good meal!”
</p>
<p>
The poor girl stood still. Footsteps were heard
approaching. They were now close by. Pilot
pricked up his ears and listened. A moment later
Jasper appeared on the scene.
</p>
<p>
When she saw Sylvia she stopped, dropped a little
courtesy, and said in a semi-familiar tone:
</p>
<p>
“And how are you this evening, Miss Leeson?”
</p>
<p>
Sylvia had not seen her as she approached. The
girl started now and turned quickly round.
</p>
<p>
“You are Jasper?” she said. “What are you
doing here?”
</p>
<p>
“Taking the air, miss. Have you any objection?”
</p>
<p>
“None, of course,” replied Sylvia.
</p>
<p>
Had there been light enough to see, Jasper would
have noticed that the girl’s face took on a cheerful
expression. She laid her hand on Pilot’s forehead.
Pilot growled. Sylvia said to him:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
</p>
<p>
“Be quiet; this is a friend.”
</p>
<p>
Pilot evidently understood the words. He wagged
his bushy tail and looked in Jasper’s direction.
Jasper came boldly up and laid her hand beside
Sylvia’s on the dog’s forehead. The tail wagged
more demonstratively.
</p>
<p>
“You have won him,” said Sylvia in a tone of
delight. “Do you know, I am glad, although I cannot
tell why I should be.”
</p>
<p>
“He looks as if he could be very formidable,” said
Jasper.—“Ah, good dog—good dog! Noble creature!
So I am your friend? Good dog!”
</p>
<p>
“But it must be rather unpleasant for visitors to
come to call on you, Miss Sylvia, with such a dog
as that loose about the place. Now, I, for instance——”
</p>
<p>
“If you had a message from Evelyn for me,” said
Sylvia, “you could call now with impunity.
Strangers cannot; that is why father keeps Pilot.
He is trained never to touch any one, but he is also
trained to keep every one out. He does that in the
best manner possible. He stands right in the person’s
path and shows his big fangs and growls.
Nobody would dream of going past him; but you
would be safe.”
</p>
<p>
Jasper stood silent.
</p>
<p>
“It may be useful,” she repeated.
</p>
<p>
“You have not come now with a message from
Evelyn?” said Sylvia, a pathetic tone in her voice.
</p>
<p>
“No, miss, I have not; but do you know, miss—do
you know what has happened to me?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>
</p>
<p>
“How should I?” replied Sylvia.
</p>
<p>
“I am turned out, miss—turned out by her ladyship—I
who had a letter from Mrs. Wynford in
Tasmania asking her ladyship to keep me always as
my little Evelyn’s friend and nurse and guardian.
Yes, Miss Sylvia, I am turned away as though I
were dirt. I am turned away, miss, although it was
only yesterday that her ladyship got the letter which
the dying mother wrote. It is hard, is it not, Miss
Leeson? It is cruel, is it not?”
</p>
<p>
“Hard and cruel!” echoed Sylvia. “It is worse.
It is a horrible sin. I wonder you stand it!”
</p>
<p>
“Now, miss, for such a pretty young lady I wonder
you have not more sense. Do you think I’d go
if I could help it?”
</p>
<p>
“What does Evelyn say?” asked Sylvia, intensely
excited.
</p>
<p>
“What does she say? Nothing. She is stunned,
I take it; but she will wake up and know what
it means. No chocolate, and no one to sleep in the
little white bed by her side.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, how she must enjoy her chocolate!” said
poor Sylvia, a sigh of longing in her voice.
</p>
<p>
“I am grand at making it,” said Jasper. “I have
spent my life in many out-of-the-way places. It
was in Madrid I learnt to make chocolate; no one
can excel me with it. I’d like well to make a cup
for you.”
</p>
<p>
“And I’d like to drink it,” said Sylvia.
</p>
<p>
“As well as I can see you in this light,” continued
Jasper, “you look as if a cup of my chocolate would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>
do you good. Chocolate made all of milk, with
plenty of bread and butter, is a meal which no one
need despise. I say, miss, shall we go back to the
“Green Man,” and shall you and me have a bit of
supper together? You would not be too proud to
take it with me although I am only my young lady’s
maid?”
</p>
<p>
“I wish I could,” said Sylvia. There was a wild
desire in her heart, a sort of passion of hunger.
“But,” she continued, “I cannot; I must go home
now.”
</p>
<p>
“Is your home near, miss?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh yes; it is just at the other side of that wall.
But please do not talk of it—father hates
people knowing. He likes us to live quite solitary.”
</p>
<p>
“And it is a big house. Yes, I can see that,”
continued Jasper, peering through the trees.
</p>
<p>
Just then a young crescent moon showed its face,
a bank of clouds swept away to the left, and Jasper
could distinctly see the square outline of an ugly
house. She saw something else also—the very white
face of the hungry Sylvia, the look which was almost
starvation in her eyes. Jasper was clever; she
might not be highly educated in the ordinary sense,
but she had been taught to use her brains, and she
had excellent brains to use. Now, as she looked at
the girl, an idea flashed through her mind.
</p>
<p>
“For some extraordinary reason that child is
downright hungry,” she said to herself. “Now,
nothing would suit my purpose better.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>
</p>
<p>
She came close to Sylvia and laid her hand on
her arm.
</p>
<p>
“I have taken a great fancy to you, miss,” she
said.
</p>
<p>
“Have you?” answered Sylvia.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, miss; and I am very lonely, and I don’t
mean to stay far away from my dear young lady.”
</p>
<p>
“Are you going to live in the village?” asked
Sylvia.
</p>
<p>
“I have a room now at the ‘Green Man,’ Miss
Leeson, but I don’t mean to stay there; I don’t care
for the landlady. And I don’t want to be, so to
speak, under her ladyship’s nose. Her ladyship
has took a mortal hatred to me, and as the village,
so to speak, belongs to the Castle, if the Castle was
to inform the ‘Green Man’ that my absence was
more to be desired than my company, why, out I’d
have to go. You can understand that, can you not,
miss?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes—of course.”
</p>
<p>
“And it is the way with all the houses round
here,” continued Jasper; “they are all under the
thumb of the Castle—under the thumb of her ladyship—and
I cannot possibly stay near my dear
young lady unless——”
</p>
<p>
“Unless?” questioned Sylvia.
</p>
<p>
“You was to give me shelter, miss, in your
house.”
</p>
<p>
Sylvia backed away, absolute terror creeping over
her face.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! I could not,” she said. “You do not know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
what you are asking. We never have any one at
The Priory. I could not possibly do it.”
</p>
<p>
“I’d pay you a pound a week,” said Jasper,
throwing down her trump card—“a pound a
week,” she continued—“twenty whole shillings put
in the palm of that pretty little hand of yours, paid
regularly in advance; and you might have me in a
big house like that without anybody knowing. I
heard you speak of the gentleman, your father; he
need never know. Is there not a room at The
Priory which no one goes into, and could not I
sleep there? And you’d have money, miss—twenty
shillings; and I’d feed you up with chocolate, miss,
and bread and butter, and—oh! lots of other things.
I have not been on a ranch in Tasmania for nothing.
You could hide me at The Priory, and you could
keep me acquainted with all that happened to my
little Eve, and I’d pay for it, miss, and not a soul on
earth would be the wiser.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, don’t!” said Sylvia—“don’t!” She covered
her face with her hands; she shook all over. “Don’t
tempt me!” she said. “Go away; do go away!
Of course I cannot have you. To deceive him—to
shock him—why——Oh, I dare not—I dare not!
It would not be safe. There are times when he is
scarcely—yes, scarcely himself; and I must not try
him too far. Oh, what have I said?”
</p>
<p>
“Nothing, my dear—nothing. You are a bit overcome.
And now, shall I tell you why?”
</p>
<p>
“No, don’t tell me anything more. Go; do go—do
go!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>
</p>
<p>
“I will go,” said Jasper, “after I have spoken.
You are trembling, and you are cold, and you are
frightened—you who ought never to tremble; you
who under ordinary circumstances ought to know no
fear; you who are beautiful—yes, beautiful! But
you tremble because that poor young body of yours
needs food and warmth—poor child!—I know.”
</p>
<p>
“Go!” said Sylvia. They were her only words.
</p>
<p>
“I will go,” answered Jasper after a pause; “but
I will come again to this same spot to-morrow night,
and then you can answer me. Her ladyship cannot
turn me out between now and to-morrow night, and
I will come then for my answer.”
</p>
<p>
She turned and left Sylvia and went straight back
to the village.
</p>
<p>
Sylvia stood still for a minute after she had gone.
She then turned very slowly and re-entered The Priory
grounds. A moment later she was in the ugly,
ill-furnished house. The hall into which she had
admitted herself was perfectly dark. There were
no carpets on the floor, and the wind whistled
through the ill-fitting casements. The young girl
fumbled about until she found a box of matches.
She struck one and lit a candle which stood in
a brass candlestick on a shelf. She then drearily
mounted the uncarpeted stairs. She went to her
own room, and opening a box, looked quickly and
furtively around her. The box contained some crusts
of bread and a few dried figs. Sylvia counted the
crusts with fingers that shook. There were five.
The crusts were not large, and they were dry.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
</p>
<p>
“I will eat one to-night,” she said to herself, “and—yes,
two of the figs. I will not eat anything now.
I wish Jasper had not tempted me. Twenty shillings,
and paid in advance; and father need never know!
Lots of room in the house! Yes; I know the one
she could have, and I could make it comfortable;
and father never goes there—never. It is away
beyond the kitchen. I could make it very comfortable.
She should have a fire, and we could
have our chocolate there. We must never, never
have any cooking that smells; we must never have
anything fried; we must just have plain things.
Oh! I dare not think any more. Mother once said
to me, ‘If your father ever, ever finds out, Sylvia,
that you have deceived him, all, all will be up.’
I won’t yield to temptation; it would be an awful
act of deceit. I cannot—I will not do it! If
he will only give me enough I will resist Jasper;
but it is hard on a girl to be so frightfully hungry.”
</p>
<p>
She sighed, pulled herself together, walked to the
window, and looked up at the watery moon.
</p>
<p>
“My own mother,” she whispered, “can you see
me, and are you sorry for me, and are you helping
me?”
</p>
<p>
Then she washed her hands, combed out her pretty,
curly black hair, and ran down-stairs. When she got
half-way down she burst into a cheerful song, and
as she bounded into a room where a man sat crouching
over a few embers on the hearth her voice rose to
positive gaiety.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
</p>
<p>
“Where have you been all this time?” said the
querulous tones.
</p>
<p>
“Learning a new song for you, dad. Come now;
supper is ready.”
</p>
<p>
“Supper!” said the man. He rose, and turned
and faced his daughter.
</p>
<p>
He was a very thin man, with hair which must
once have been as black as Sylvia’s own; his eyes,
dark as the young girl’s, were sunk so far back in his
head that they gleamed like half-burnt-out coals;
his cheeks were very hollow, and he gave a pathetic
laugh as he turned and faced the girl.
</p>
<p>
“I have been making a calculation,” he said, “and
it is my firm impression that we are spending a great
deal more than is necessary. There are further reductions
which it is quite possible to make. But
come, child—come. How fat and well and strong
you look, and how hearty your voice is! You are
a merry creature, Sylvia, and the joy of my life.
Were it not for you I should never hold out. And
you are so good at pinching and contriving, dear!
But there, I give you too many luxuries don’t I,
my little one? I spoil you, don’t I? What did you
say was ready?”
</p>
<p>
“Supper, father—supper.”
</p>
<p>
“Supper!” said Mr. Leeson. “Why, it seems only
a moment ago that we dined.”
</p>
<p>
“It is six hours ago, father.”
</p>
<p>
“Now, Sylvia, if there is one thing I dislike more
than another, it is that habit of yours of counting
the hours between your meals. It is a distinct trace
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
of greediness and of the lower nature. Ah, my child,
when will you live high above your mere bodily desires?
Supper, you say? I shall not be able to eat
a morsel, but I will go with you, dear, if you like.
Come, lead the way, my singing-bird; lead the way.”
</p>
<p>
Sylvia took a candle and lighted it. She then
went on in front of her father. They traversed a
long and dark passage, and presently she threw open
the door of as melancholy and desolate a room as
could be found anywhere in England.
</p>
<p>
The paper on the wall was scarcely perceptible, so
worn was it by the long passage of time. The floor
was bare of any carpet; there was a deal table at one
end of the room; on the table a small white cloth
had been placed. A piece of bread was on a wooden
platter on this table. There was also a jug of water
and a couple of baked potatoes. Sylvia had put
these potatoes into the oven before she went out,
otherwise there would not have been anything hot at
all for the meager repast. The grate was destitute
of any fire; and although there were blinds to the
windows, there were no curtains. The night was a
bitterly cold one, and the girl, insufficiently clothed
as well as unfed, shivered as she went into the room.
</p>
<p>
“What a palatial room this is!” said Mr. Leeson.
“I really often think I did wrong to come to this
house. I have not the slightest doubt that my
neighbors imagine that I am a man of means. It
is extremely wrong to encourage that impression,
and I trust, Sylvia, that you never by word or action
do so. A lady you are, my dear, and a lady you will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
look whatever you wear; but that beautiful simplicity
which rises above mere dress and mere food is
what I should like to inculcate in your nature, my
sweet child. Ah! potatoes—and hot! My dear
Sylvia, was this necessary?”
</p>
<p>
“There are only two, father—one for you and one
for me.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, well! I suppose the young must have their
dainties as long as the world lasts,” said Mr. Leeson.
“Sit down, my dear, and eat. I will stand and
watch you.”
</p>
<p>
“Won’t you eat anything, father?” said the girl.
A curious expression filled her dark eyes. She
longed for him to eat, and yet she could not help
thinking how supporting and soothing and satisfying
both those potatoes would be, and all that hunch of
dry bread.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Leeson paused before replying:
</p>
<p>
“It would be impossible for you to eat more than
one potato, and it would be a sin that the other
should be wasted. I may as well have it.” He
dropped into a chair. “Not that I am the least hungry,”
he added as he took the largest potato and put
it on his plate. “Still, anything is preferable to
waste. What a pity it is that no one has discovered
a use for the skins, for these as a rule have absolutely
to be wasted! When I have gone through some
abstruse calculations over which I am at present engaged,
I shall turn my attention to the matter.
Quantities of nourishing food are doubtless wasted
every year by the manner in which potato-skins are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>
thrown away. Ah! and this bread, Sylvia—how long
has it been in the house?”
</p>
<p>
“I got it exactly a week ago,” said Sylvia. “It is
quite the ordinary kind.”
</p>
<p>
“It is too fresh, my dear. In future we must not
eat new bread.”
</p>
<p>
“It is a week old, father.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t take me up in that captious way. I say
we must not eat new bread. It was only to-day I
came across a book which said that bread when turning
slightly—very slightly—moldy satisfies the appetite
far more readily than new bread. Then you will
see for yourself, Sylvia, that a loaf of such bread may
be made to go nearly as far as two loaves of the
ordinary kind. You follow me, do you not, singing-bird?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, father—yes. But may I eat my potato now
while it is hot?”
</p>
<p>
“How the young do crave for unnecessary indulgences!”
said Mr. Leeson; but he broke his own
potato in half, and Sylvia seized the opportunity to
demolish hers.
</p>
<p>
Alack and alas! when it was finished, every scrap
of it, scarcely any even of the skin being left, she felt
almost more hungry than ever. She stretched out
her hand for the bread. Mr. Leeson raised his eyes
as she did so and gave her a reproachful glance.
</p>
<p>
“You will be ill,” he said. “You will suffer from
a bilious attack. Take it—take it if you want it; I
am the last to interfere with your natural appetite.”
</p>
<p>
Sylvia ate; she ate although her father’s displeased
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
eyes were fixed on her face. She helped herself
twice to the stale and untempting loaf. Delicious it
tasted. She could even have demolished every scrap
of it and still have felt half-wild with hunger. But
she was eating it now to give herself courage, for
she had made up her mind—speak she must.
</p>
<p>
The meal came to an end. Mr. Leeson had finished
his potato; Sylvia had very nearly consumed the
bread.
</p>
<p>
“There will be a very small breakfast to-morrow,”
he said in a mournful tone; “but you, Sylvia, after
your enormous supper, will scarcely require a large
one.”
</p>
<p>
Sylvia made no answer. She took her father’s
hand and walked back with him through the passage.
The fire was out now in the sitting-room;
Sylvia brought her father’s greatcoat.
</p>
<p>
“Put it on,” she said. “I want to sit close to you,
and I want to talk.”
</p>
<p>
He smiled at her and wrapped himself obediently
in his coat. It was lined with fur, a relic of bygone
and happier days. Sylvia turned the big fur collar
up round his ears; then she drew herself close to
him. She seated herself on his lap.
</p>
<p>
“Put your arm round me; I am cold,” she said.
</p>
<p>
“Cold, my dear little girl!” he said. “Why, so
you are! How very strange! It is doubtless from
overeating.”
</p>
<p>
“No, father.”
</p>
<p>
“Why that ‘No, father’? What a curious expression
is in your voice, Sylvia, my dear! Since
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
your mother’s death you have been my one comfort.
Heart and soul you have gone with me through the
painful life which I am obliged to lead. I know
that I am doing the right thing. I am no longer
lavishly wasting that which has been entrusted to
me, but am, on the contrary, saving for the day of
need. My dear girl, you and I have planned our life
of retrenchment. How much does our food cost us
for a week?”
</p>
<p>
“Very, very little, father. Too little.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean by that?”
</p>
<p>
“Father, forgive me; I must speak.”
</p>
<p>
“What is wrong?”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Leeson pushed his daughter away. His eyes,
which had been full of kindness, grew sharp and
became slightly narrowed; a watchful expression
came into his face.
</p>
<p>
“Beware, Sylvia, how you agitate me; you know
the consequences.”
</p>
<p>
“Since mother died,” answered the girl, “I have
never agitated you; I have always tried to do exactly
as you wished.”
</p>
<p>
“On the whole you have been a good girl; your
one and only fault has been your greediness. Last
night, it is true, you displeased me very deeply, but
on your promise never to transgress so again I have
forgiven you.”
</p>
<p>
“Father,” said Sylvia in a tremulous tone, “I must
speak, and now. You must not be angry, father;
but you say that we spend too much on housekeeping.
We do not; we spend too little.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>
</p>
<p>
“Sylvia!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; I am not going to be afraid,” continued the
girl. “You were displeased with me to-night—yes,
I know you were—because I nearly finished the
bread. I finished it because—because I was hungry;
yes, hungry. And, father, I do not mind how stale
the bread is, nor how poor the food, but I must—I
must have enough. You do not give me enough.
No, you do not. I cannot bear the pain. I cannot
bear the neuralgia. I cannot bear the cold of this
house. I want warmth, and I want food, and I want
clothes that will keep the chill away. That is
all—just physical things. I do not ask for fun,
nor for companions of my own age, nor for anything
of that sort, but I do ask you, father, not to
oblige me to lead this miserable, starved life in the
future.”
</p>
<p>
Sylvia paused; her courage, after all, was short-lived.
The look on her father’s face arrested her
words. He wore a stony look. His face, which had
been fairly animated, had lost almost all expression.
The pupils of his eyes were narrowed to a pin’s point.
Those eyes fixed themselves on the girl’s face as
though they were gimlets, as though they meant to
pierce right into her very soul. Alarm now took the
place of beseeching.
</p>
<p>
“Never mind,” she said—“never mind; it was
just your wild little rebellious Sylvia. Don’t
look at me like that. Don’t—don’t! Oh, I will
bear it—I will bear it! Don’t look at me like
that!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
</p>
<p>
“Go to your room,” was his answer, “at once.
Go to your room.”
</p>
<p>
She was a spirited girl, but she crept out of the
room as though some one had beaten her.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span><a name='chXIII' id='chXIII'></a>CHAPTER XIII.—JASPER TO THE RESCUE.</h2>
<p>
The next evening, at the hour which she had
named, Jasper walked down the road which led to
The Priory. She walked with a confident step; she
had very little doubt that Sylvia would be waiting
for her. She was not far wrong in her expectations.
A girl, wrapped in a cloak, was standing by a hedge.
By the girl stood the mastiff Pilot. Pilot was not
too well fed, but he was better fed than Sylvia. It
was necessary, according to Mr. Leeson’s ideas, that
Pilot should be strong enough to guard The Priory
against thieves, against unwelcome, prying visitors—against
the whole of the human race. But even
Pilot could be caught by guile, and Sylvia was determined
that he should be friends with Jasper. As
Jasper came up the road Sylvia advanced a step or
two to meet her.
</p>
<p>
“Well, dear,” said Jasper in a cheerful tone, “am
I to come in, and am I to be welcome?”
</p>
<p>
“You are to come in,” said Sylvia. “I have made
up my mind. I have been preparing your room all
day. If he finds it out I dare not think what will
happen. But come—do come; I am ready and
waiting for you.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
</p>
<p>
“I thought you would be. I can fetch the rest
of my things to-morrow. Can we slip into my room
now?”
</p>
<p>
“We can. Come at once.—Pilot, remember that
this lady is our friend.—One moment, please, Jasper;
I must be quite certain that Pilot does not do you
an injury.—Pilot, give your right paw to this lady.”
</p>
<p>
Pilot looked anxiously from Jasper to Sylvia;
then, with a deliberate movement, and a great expression
of condescension on his face, he did extend
his right paw. Jasper took it.
</p>
<p>
“Kiss him now just between his eyes,” said Sylvia.
</p>
<p>
“Good gracious, child! I never kissed a dog in
my life.”
</p>
<p>
“Kiss him as you value your future safety. You
surely do not want to be a prisoner at The Priory!”
</p>
<p>
“Heaven forbid!” said Jasper. “What I want
to do, and what I mean to do, is to parade before her
ladyship just where her ladyship cannot touch me.
She could turn me out of every house in the place,
but not from here. I do not want to keep it any
secret from her ladyship that I am staying with
you, Miss Sylvia.”
</p>
<p>
“We can talk of that afterwards,” said Sylvia.
“Come into the house now.”
</p>
<p>
The two turned, the dog accompanying them.
They passed through the heavy iron gates and
walked softly up the avenue.
</p>
<p>
“What a close, dismal sort of place!” said Jasper.
</p>
<p>
“Please—please do not speak so loud; father may
overhear us.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
</p>
<p>
“Then mum’s the word,” said the woman.
</p>
<p>
“Step on the grass here, please.”
</p>
<p>
Jasper did exactly as Sylvia directed her, and the
result was that soon the two found themselves in as
empty a kitchen as Jasper had ever beheld in the
whole course of her life.
</p>
<p>
“Sakes, child!” she cried, “is this where you cook
your meals?”
</p>
<p>
“The kitchen does quite well enough for our
requirements,” said Sylvia in a low tone.
</p>
<p>
“And where are you going to put me?”
</p>
<p>
“In this room. I think in the happy days when
the house was full this room must have been used
as the servants’ hall. See, there is a nice fireplace,
with a good fire in it. I have drawn down the
blinds, and I have put thick curtains—the only thick
curtains we possess—across the windows. There
are shutters too. If my father does walk abroad he
cannot see any light through this window. But I
am sorry to say you can have a fire only at night,
for he would be very angry if he saw the smoke
ascending in the daytime.”
</p>
<p>
“Hard lines! But I suppose, as I made the
offer, I must abide by it,” said Jasper. “The room
looks bare but well enough. It is clean, I suppose?”
</p>
<p>
“It is about as clean as I can make it,” said
Sylvia, with a dreary sigh.
</p>
<p>
“As clean as you can make it? Have you not a
servant, my dear?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh no; we do not keep a servant.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
</p>
<p>
“Then I expect my work is cut out for me,” said
Jasper, who was thoroughly good-natured, and had
taken an immense fancy to Sylvia.
</p>
<p>
“Please,” said the girl earnestly, “you must not
attempt to make the place look the least bit better;
if you do, father will find out, and then——”
</p>
<p>
“Find out!” said Jasper. “If I were you, you
poor little thing, I would let him. But there! I am
in, and possession is everything. I have brought
my supper with me, and I thought maybe you would
not mind sharing it. I have it in this basket. This
basket contains what I require for the night and our
supper as well. I pay you twenty shillings a week,
and buy my own coals, so I suppose at night at least
I may have a big fire.”
</p>
<p>
Here Jasper went to a large, old-fashioned wooden
hod, and taking big lumps of coal, put them on the
fire. It blazed right merrily, and the heat filled the
room. Sylvia stole close to it and stretched out her
thin, white hands for the warmth.
</p>
<p>
“How delicious!” she said.
</p>
<p>
“You poor girl! Can you spend the rest of the
evening with me?”
</p>
<p>
“I must go to father. But, do you know, he has
prohibited anything but bread for supper.”
</p>
<p>
“What!”
</p>
<p>
“He does not want it himself, and he says that I
can do with bread. Oh, I could if there were enough
bread!”
</p>
<p>
“You poor, poor child! Why, it was Providence
which sent me all the way from Tasmania to make
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>
you comfortable and to save the bit of life in your
body.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I cannot—I cannot!” said Sylvia. Her
composure gave way; she sank into a chair and
burst into tears.
</p>
<p>
“You cannot what, you poor child?”
</p>
<p>
“Take everything from you. I—I am a lady. In
reality we are rich—yes, quite rich—only father has
a craze, and he won’t spend money. He hoards instead
of spending. It began in mother’s lifetime,
and he has got worse and worse and worse. They
say it is in the family, and his father had it, and his
father before him. When father was young he was
extravagant, and people thought that he would
never inherit the craze of a miser; but it has grown
with his middle life, and if mother were alive now
she would not know him.”
</p>
<p>
“And you are the sufferer, you poor lamb!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; I get very hungry at times.”
</p>
<p>
“But, my dear, with twenty shillings a week you
need not be hungry.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh no. I cannot realize it. But I have to be
careful; father must not see any difference.”
</p>
<p>
“We will have our meals here,” said Jasper.
</p>
<p>
“But we must not light a fire by day,” said the
girl.
</p>
<p>
“Never mind; I can manage. Are there not such
things as spirit-lamps? Oh yes, I am a born cook.
Now then, go away, my dear; have your meal of
bread with your father, say good-night to him, and
then slip back to me.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
</p>
<p>
Sylvia ran off almost joyfully. In about an hour
she returned. During that time Jasper had contrived
to make a considerable change in the room. The
warmth of the fire filled every corner now the thick
curtains at the window looked almost cheerful; the
heavy door tightly shut allowed no cold air to penetrate.
On the little table she had spread a white
cloth, and now that table was graced by a great
jug of steaming chocolate, a loaf of crisp white
bread, and a little pat of butter; and besides these
things there were a small tongue and a tiny pot of
jam.
</p>
<p>
“Things look better, don’t they?” said Jasper.
“And now, my dearie, you shall not only eat in
this room, but you shall sleep in that warm bed in
which I have just put my own favorite hot-water
bag.”
</p>
<p>
“But you—you?” said Sylvia.
</p>
<p>
“I either lie down by your side or I stay in the
chair by the fire. I am going to warm you up and
pet you, for you need it, you poor, brave little
girl!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span><a name='chXIV' id='chXIV'></a>CHAPTER XIV.—CHANGE OF PLANS.</h2>
<p>
A whole month had gone by since Jasper had
left Evelyn, and Evelyn after a fashion had grown
accustomed to her absence. Considerable changes
had taken place in the little girl during that time.
She was no longer dressed in an <em>outré</em> style. She
wore her hair as any other very young girl of her
age would. She had ceased to consider herself
grown-up; and although she knew deep down in
her heart that she was the heiress—that by and by
all the fine property would belong to her—and although
she still gloried in the fact, either fear, or perhaps
the dawnings of a better nature prevented her
talking so much about it as she had done during
the early days of her stay at Castle Wynford. The
guests had all departed, and schoolroom life held
sway over both the girls. Miss Sinclair was the
very soul of order; she insisted on meals being
served in the schoolroom to the minute, and schoolroom
work being pursued with regularity and
method. There were so many hours for work and
so many hours for amusement. There were times
when the girls might be present with the Squire and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
Lady Frances, and times when they only enjoyed
the society of Miss Sinclair. There were masters
for several accomplishments, and the girls had horses
to ride, and a pony-carriage was placed at their disposal,
and the hours were so full of occupation that
they went by on wings. Evelyn looked fifty times
better and happier than she had done when she first
arrived at Castle Wynford, and even Lady Frances
was forced to own that the child was turning out
better than she expected. How long this comparatively
happy state of things might have lasted it is
hard to say, but it was brought to an abrupt conclusion
by an event which occurred just then. This
was no less than the departure of kind Miss Sinclair.
Her mother had died quite suddenly; her father
needed her at home. She could not even stay for the
customary period after giving notice of her intention
to leave. Lady Frances, under the circumstances,
did not press her; and now the subject of how the
two girls were best to be educated was ceaselessly
discussed. Lady Frances was a born educationist;
she had the greatest love for subjects dealing with
the education of the young. She had her own
theories with regard to this important matter, and
when Miss Sinclair went away she was for a time
puzzled how to act. To get another governess was,
of course, the only thing to be done; but for a time
she wavered much as to the advisability of sending
Evelyn to school.
</p>
<p>
“I really think she ought to go,” said Lady
Frances to the Squire. “Even now she does not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>
half know her place. She has improved, I grant
you, but the thorough discipline of school would do
her good.”
</p>
<p>
“You have never sent Audrey to school,” was the
Squire’s answer.
</p>
<p>
“I have not, certainly; but Audrey is so different.”
</p>
<p>
“I should not like anything to be done in Evelyn’s
case which has not been done in Audrey’s,” was the
Squire’s reply.
</p>
<p>
“But surely you cannot compare the girls!”
</p>
<p>
“I do not intend to compare them. They are
absolutely different. Audrey is all that the heart
of the proudest father could desire, and Evelyn is
still——”
</p>
<p>
“A little savage at heart,” interrupted Lady
Frances.
</p>
<p>
“Yes; but she is taming, and I think she has
some fine points in her—indeed, I am sure of it.
She is, for instance, very affectionate.”
</p>
<p>
Lady Frances looked somewhat indignant.
</p>
<p>
“I am tired of hearing of Evelyn’s good qualities.
When I perceive them for myself I shall be the first
to acknowledge them. But now, my dear Edward,
the point to be considered is this: What are we to
do at once? It is nearly the middle of the term.
To give those two girls holidays would be ruinous.
There is an excellent school of a very superior sort
kept by the Misses Henderson in that large house
just outside the village. What do you say to their
both going there until we can look round us and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
find a suitable governess to take Miss Sinclair’s
place?”
</p>
<p>
“If they both go it does not so much matter,”
said the Squire. “You can arrange it in that way
if you like, my dear Frances.”
</p>
<p>
Lady Frances gave a sigh of relief. She was
much interested in the Misses Henderson; she herself
had helped them to start their school. Accordingly,
that very afternoon she ordered the carriage
and drove to Chepstow House. The Misses Henderson
were expecting her, and received her in state
in their drawing-room.
</p>
<p>
“You know what I have come about?” she said.
“Now, the thing is this—can you do it?”
</p>
<p>
“I am quite certain of one thing,” said the elder
Miss Henderson—“that there will be no stone left
unturned on our parts to make the experiment
satisfactory.”
</p>
<p>
“Poor, dear Miss Sinclair—it is too terrible her
having to leave!” said Lady Frances. “We shall
never get her like again. To find exactly the
governess for girls like my daughter and niece is
no easy matter.”
</p>
<p>
“As to your dear daughter, she certainly will not be
hard to manage,” said the younger Miss Henderson.
</p>
<p>
“You are right, Miss Lucy,” said Lady Frances,
turning to her and speaking with decision. “I have
always endeavored to train Audrey in those nice
observances, those moral principles, and that high
tone which befits a girl who is a lady and who in
the future will occupy a high position.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
</p>
<p>
“But your niece—your niece; she is the real
problem,” said the elder Miss Henderson.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” answered Lady Frances, with a sigh.
“When she came to me she was little less than a
savage. She has improved. I do not like her—I
do not pretend for a moment that I do—but I wish
to give the poor child every possible advantage, and
I am anxious, if possible, that my prejudice shall
not weigh with me in any sense in my dealings with
her; but she requires very firm treatment.”
</p>
<p>
“She shall have it,” said the elder Miss Henderson;
and a look of distinct pleasure crossed her face.
“I have had refractory girls before now,” she said,
“and I may add with confidence, Lady Frances, that
I have always broken them in. I do not expect to
fail in the case of Miss Wynford.”
</p>
<p>
“Firm discipline is essential,” replied Lady
Frances. “I told Miss Sinclair so, and she agreed
with me. I do not exactly know what her method
was, nor how she managed, but the child seemed
happy, she learnt her lessons correctly, and, in short,
she has improved. I trust the improvement will
continue under your management.”
</p>
<p>
Here the good lady, after adding a few more
words with regard to hours, etc., took her leave.
The girls were to go to Chepstow House as day-pupils,
and the work of their education at that
distinguished school was to begin on the following
morning.
</p>
<p>
Evelyn was rather pleased than otherwise when
she heard that she was to be sent to school. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
had cried and flung her arms round Miss Sinclair’s
neck when that lady was taking leave of her.
Audrey, on the contrary, had scarcely spoken; her
face looked a little whiter than usual, and her eyes
a little darker. She took the governess’s hand and
wrung it, and as she bent forward to kiss her again
on the cheek, Miss Sinclair kissed her and whispered
something to her. But it was poor Evelyn who
cried. The carriage took the governess away, and
the girls looked at each other.
</p>
<p>
“I did not know you could be so stony-hearted,”
said Evelyn. She took out her handkerchief as she
spoke and mopped her eyes. “Oh dear!” she added,
“I am quite broken-hearted without her. I am
<em>such</em> an affectionate girl.”
</p>
<p>
“We had better prepare for school,” said Audrey.
“We are to go there to-morrow morning, remember.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” answered Evelyn, her eyes brightening;
“and do you know, although I am terribly sorry to
part with dear Miss Sinclair, I am glad about school.
Mothery always wished me to go; she said that
talents like mine could never find a proper vent
except in school-life. I wonder what sort of girls
there are at Chepstow House?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know anything about it,” said Audrey.
</p>
<p>
“Are you sorry to go, Audrey?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes—rather. I have never been to school.”
</p>
<p>
“How funny it will be to see you looking shy and
awkward! Will you be shy and awkward?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t think so. I hope not.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
</p>
<p>
“It would be fun to see it, all the same,” said
Evelyn. “But there, I am going for a race; my
legs are quite stiff for want of running. I used to
run such a lot in Tasmania on the ranch! Often
and often I ran a whole mile without stopping.
Good-by for the present. I suppose I may do what
I like to-day.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn rushed off into the grounds. She was
running at full speed through the shrubbery on her
way to a big field, which was known as the ten-acre
field, on the other side of the turnstile, when she
came full tilt against her uncle. He stopped, took
her hand, and looked kindly at her.
</p>
<p>
“Do you know, Uncle Edward,” she said, “that
I am going to school to-morrow?”
</p>
<p>
“So I hear, my dear little girl; and I hope you
will be happy there.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn made no reply. Her eyes sparkled. After
a time she said slowly:
</p>
<p>
“I am glad; mother wished me to go.”
</p>
<p>
“You love your mother’s memory very much, do
you not, Eve?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” she said; and tears came into her big,
strange-looking eyes. “I love her just as much as
if she were alive,” she continued—“better, I think.
Whenever I am sad she seems near to me.”
</p>
<p>
“You would do anything to please her, would you
not, Eve?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” answered the child.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I wish to say something to you. You had
a great fight when you came here, but I think to a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
certain extent you have conquered. Our ways were
not your ways—everything was strange—and at
first, my dear little girl, you rebelled, and were not
very happy.”
</p>
<p>
“I was miserable—miserable!”
</p>
<p>
“But you have done, on the whole, well; and if
your mother could come back again she would be
pleased. I thought I should like to tell you.”
</p>
<p>
“But, please, Uncle Edward, why would mothery
be pleased? She often told me that I was not to
submit; that I was to hold my own; that——”
</p>
<p>
“My dear, she told you those things when she
was on earth; but now, in the presence of God, she
has learnt many new lessons, and I am sure, could
she now speak to you, she would tell you that you
did right to submit, and were doing well when you
tried to please me, for instance.”
</p>
<p>
“Why you, Uncle Edward?”
</p>
<p>
“Because I am your father’s brother, and because
I loved your father better than any one on earth.”
</p>
<p>
“Better than Aunt Frances?” said Evelyn, with
a sparkle of pleasure in her eyes.
</p>
<p>
“In a different, quite a different way. Ay, I
loved him well, and I would do my utmost to promote
the happiness of his child.”
</p>
<p>
“I love you,” said the little girl. “I am glad—I
am <em>glad</em> that you are my uncle.”
</p>
<p>
She raised his hand, pressed it to her lips, and the
next moment was lost to view.
</p>
<p>
“Queer, erratic little soul!” thought Squire Wynford
to himself. “If only we can train her aright!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
I often feel that Frank is watching me, and wondering
how I am dealing with the child. It seems
almost cruel that Frances should dislike her, but I
trust in the end all will be well.”
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Evelyn, having tired herself racing
round the ten-acre field, suddenly conceived a daring
idea. She had known long ere this that her beloved
Jasper was not in reality out of reach. More than
once the maid and the little girl had met. These
meetings were by no means conducive to Evelyn’s
best interests, but they added a great spice of excitement
to her life; and the thought of seeing her
now, and telling her of the change which was about
to take place with regard to her education, was too
great a temptation to be resisted. Evelyn accordingly,
skirting the high-roads and making many
detours through fields and lanes, presently arrived
close to The Priory. She had never ventured yet
into The Priory; she had as a rule sent a message to
Jasper, and Jasper had waited for her outside. She
knew now that she must be quick or she would be
late for lunch. She did not want on this day of all
days to seriously displease Lady Frances. She went,
therefore, boldly up to the gate, pushed it open, and
entered. Here she was immediately confronted by
Pilot. Pilot walked down the path, uttered one or
two deep bays, growled audibly, and showed his
strong white teeth. Whatever Evelyn’s faults were,
she was no coward. An angry dog standing in her
path was not going to deter her. But she was
afraid of something else. Jasper had told her how
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
insecure her tenure at The Priory was—how it all
absolutely depended on Mr. Leeson never finding
out that she was there. Evelyn therefore did not
want to bring Mr. Leeson to her rescue. Were there
no means by which she could induce Pilot to let her
pass? She went boldly up to the dog. The dog
growled more fiercely, and put himself in an attitude
which the little girl knew well meant that he was
going to spring. She did not want him to bound
upon her; she knew he was much stronger than
herself.
</p>
<p>
“Good, good dog—good, good,” she said.
</p>
<p>
But Pilot, exasperated beyond measure, began
to bark savagely.
</p>
<p>
Who was this small girl who dared to defy him?
His custom was to stand as he stood to-day and
terrify every one off the premises. But this small
person did not mean to go. He therefore really lost
his temper, and became decidedly dangerous.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Leeson, in his study, was busily engaged over
some of that abstruse work which occupied all his
time. He was annoyed at Pilot’s barking, and went
to the window to ascertain the cause. He saw a
stumpy, stout-looking little girl standing on the
path, and Pilot barring her way. He opened the
window and called out:
</p>
<p>
“Go away, child; go away. We don’t have
visitors here. Go away immediately, and shut the
gate firmly after you.”
</p>
<p>
“But, if you please,” said Evelyn, “I cannot go
away. I want to see Sylvia.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>
</p>
<p>
“You cannot see her. Go away.”
</p>
<p>
“No, I won’t,” said Evelyn, her courage coming
now boldly to her aid. “I have come here on
business, and I must see Sylvia. You dare not let
your horrid dog spring on me; and I am going to
stand just where I am till Sylvia comes.”
</p>
<p>
These very independent words astonished Mr.
Leeson so much that he absolutely went out of the
house and came down the avenue to meet Evelyn.
</p>
<p>
“Who are you, child?” he said, as the bold light
eyes were fixed on his face.
</p>
<p>
“I am Evelyn Wynford, the heiress of Wynford
Castle.”
</p>
<p>
A twinkle of mirth came into Mr. Leeson’s eyes.
</p>
<p>
“And so you want Sylvia, heiress of Wynford
Castle?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; I want to speak to her.”
</p>
<p>
“She is not in at present. She is never in at this
hour. Sylvia likes an open-air life, and I am glad
to encourage her in her taste. May I show you to
the gate?”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you,” replied Evelyn, who felt considerably
crestfallen.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Leeson, with his very best manners, accompanied
the little girl to the high iron gates. These
he opened, bowed to her as she passed through them,
and then shut them in her face, drawing a big bar
inside as he did so.
</p>
<p>
“Good Pilot—excellent, brave, admirable dog!”
Evelyn heard him say; and she ground her small
white teeth in anger.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
</p>
<p>
A moment or two later, to her infinite delight, she
saw Jasper coming up the road to meet her. In an
instant the child and maid were in each other’s arms.
Evelyn was petting Jasper, and kissing her over and
over again on her dark cheek.
</p>
<p>
“Oh Jasper,” said the little girl, “I got such a
fright! I came here to see you, and I was met by
that horrible dog; and then a dreadful-looking old
man came out and told me I was to go right away,
and he petted the dog for trying to attack me. I
was not frightened, of course—it is not likely that
mothery’s little girl would be easily afraid—but, all
the same, it was not pleasant. Why do you live
in such a horrid, horrid place, Jasper darling?”
</p>
<p>
“Why do I live there?” answered Jasper. “Now,
look at me—look me full in the face. I live in
that house because Providence wills it, because—because——
Oh, I need not waste time telling you
the reason. I live there because I am near to you,
and for another reason; and I hope to goodness that
you have not gone and made mischief, for if that
dreadful old man, as you call him, finds out for a
single moment that I am there, good-by to poor
Miss Sylvia’s chance of life.”
</p>
<p>
“You are quite silly about Sylvia,” said Evelyn
in a jealous tone.
</p>
<p>
“She is a very fine, brave young lady,” was Jasper’s
answer.
</p>
<p>
“I wish you would not talk of her like that; you
make me feel quite cross.”
</p>
<p>
“You always were a jealous little piece,” said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
Jasper, giving her former charge a look of admiration;
“but you need not be, Eve, for no one—no
one shall come inside my little white Eve. But
there, now; do tell me. You did not say anything
about me to Mr. Leeson?”
</p>
<p>
“No, I did not,” said Evelyn. “I only told him
I had come to see Sylvia. Was it not good of me,
Jasper? Was it not clever and smart?”
</p>
<p>
“It was like you, pet,” said Jasper. “You always
were the canniest little thing—always, always.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn was delighted at these words of praise.
</p>
<p>
“But how did you get here, my pet? Does her
ladyship know you are out?”
</p>
<p>
“No, her ladyship does not,” replied Evelyn, with
a laugh. “I should be very sorry to let her
know, either. I came here all by myself because I
wanted to see you, Jasper. I have got news for
you.”
</p>
<p>
“Indeed, pet; and what is that?”
</p>
<p>
“Cannot you guess?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, how can I? Perhaps that you have got
courage and are sleeping by yourself. You cannot
stand that horrid old Read; you would rather be
alone than have her near you.”
</p>
<p>
“Read has not slept in my room for over three
weeks,” said Evelyn proudly. “I am not at all
nervous now. It was Miss Sinclair who told me
how silly I was to want any one to sleep close to
me.”
</p>
<p>
“But you would like your old Jasper again?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes—oh yes; you are different.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well, and what is the change, dear?”
</p>
<p>
“It is this: poor Miss Sinclair—dear, nice Miss
Sinclair—has been obliged to leave.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, well, I am not sorry for that,” said Jasper.
“I was getting a bit jealous of her. You seemed
to be getting on so well with her.”
</p>
<p>
“So I was. I quite loved her; she made my lessons
so interesting. But what do you think, Jasper?
Although I am very sorry she has gone, I am glad
about the other thing. Audrey and I are going to
school, as daily boarders, just outside the village;
Chepstow House it is called. We are going to-morrow
morning. Mothery would like that; she
always did want me to go to school. I am glad.
Are you not glad too, Jasper?”
</p>
<p>
“That depends,” said Jasper in an oracular voice.
</p>
<p>
“What does it all depend on? Why do you speak
in that funny way?”
</p>
<p>
“It depends on you, my dear. I have heard a
great deal about schools. Some are nice and some
are not. In some they give you a lot of freedom,
and you are petted and fussed over; in others they
discipline you. When you are disciplined you don’t
like it. If I were you——”
</p>
<p>
“Yes—what?”
</p>
<p>
“I would stay there if I liked it, and if I did not
I would not stay. I would not have my spirit broke.
They often break your spirit at school. I would
not put up with that if I were you.”
</p>
<p>
“I am sure they won’t break my spirit,” said
Evelyn in a tone of alarm. “Why do you speak so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
dismally, Jasper? Do you know, I am almost sorry
I told you. I was so happy at the thought of going,
and now you have made me miserable. No,
there is not the slightest fear that they will break
my spirit.”
</p>
<p>
“Then that is all right, dear. Don’t forget that
you are the heiress.”
</p>
<p>
“I could let them know at school, could I not?”
</p>
<p>
“I would if I were you,” said the injudicious
woman. “I would tell the girls if I were you.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh yes; so I can. I wonder if they will be nice
girls at Chepstow House?”
</p>
<p>
“You let them feel your power, and don’t knock
under to any of them,” said Jasper. “And now,
my dear, I must really send you home. There, I’ll
walk a bit of the way back with you. You are
looking very bonny, my little white Eve; you have
got quite a nice color in your cheeks. I am glad
you are well; and I am glad, too, that the governess
has gone, for I don’t want her to get the
better of me. Remember what I said about
school.”
</p>
<p>
“That I will, Jasper; I’ll be sure to remember.”
</p>
<p>
“It would please her ladyship if you got on well
there,” continued Jasper.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t want to please Aunt Frances.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course you don’t. Nasty, horrid thing! I
shall never forgive her for turning me off. Now
then, dear, you had best run home. I don’t want
her to see us talking together. Good-by, pet;
good-by.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span><a name='chXV' id='chXV'></a>CHAPTER XV.—SCHOOL.</h2>
<p>
The girls at Chepstow House were quite excited
at the advent of Audrey and Evelyn. They were
nice girls, nearly all of them; they were ladies, too,
of a good class; but they had not been at Chepstow
House long without coming under the influence of
what dominated the entire place—that big house on
the hill, with its castellated roof and its tower, its
moat too, and its big, big gardens, its spacious park,
and all its surroundings. It was a place to talk
to their friends at home about, and to think of
and wonder over when at school. The girls at
Chepstow House had often looked with envy at
Audrey as she rode by on her pretty Arab pony.
They talked of her to each other; they criticised
her appearance; they praised her actions.
She was a sort of princess to them. Then there
appeared on the scene another little princess—a
strange child, without style, without manners, without
any personal attractions; and this child, it was
whispered, was the real heiress. By and by pretty
Audrey would cease to live at Castle Wynford, and
the little girl with the extraordinary face would be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
monarch of all she surveyed. The girls commented
over this story amongst each other, as girls will;
and when the younger Miss Henderson—Miss Lucy,
as they called her—told them that Audrey Wynford
and her cousin Evelyn were coming as schoolgirls
to Chepstow House their excitement knew no
bounds.
</p>
<p>
“They are coming here,” said Miss Lucy, “and I
trust that all you girls who belong to the house will
treat them as they ought to be treated.”
</p>
<p>
“And how is that, Miss Lucy?” said Brenda Fox,
the tallest and most important girl in the school.
</p>
<p>
“You must treat them as ladies, but at the same
time as absolutely your equals in every respect,” said
Miss Lucy. “They are coming to school partly to
find their level; we must be kind to them, but there
is to be no difference made between them and the
rest of you. Now, Brenda, go with the other girls
into the Blue Parlor and attend to your preparation
for Signor Forre.”
</p>
<p>
Brenda and her companions went away, and during
the rest of the day, whenever they had a spare
moment, the girls talked over Audrey and Evelyn.
</p>
<p>
The next morning the cousins arrived. They came
in Audrey’s pretty governess-cart, and Audrey drove
the fat pony herself. A groom took it back to the
Castle, with orders to come for his young ladies at
six in the evening, for Lady Frances had arranged
that the girls were to have both early dinner and tea
at school.
</p>
<p>
They both entered the house, and even Audrey
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
just for a moment felt slightly nervous. The elder
Miss Henderson took them into her private sitting-room,
asked them a few questions, and then, desiring
them to follow her, went down a long passage
which led into the large schoolroom. Here the girls,
about forty in number, were all assembled. Miss
Henderson introduced the new pupils with a few brief
words. She then went up to Miss Lucy and asked her,
as soon as prayers were over, to question both Audrey
and Evelyn with regard to their attainments, and to
put them into suitable classes.
</p>
<p>
The Misses Wynford sat side by side during
prayers, and immediately afterwards were taken
into Miss Lucy’s private sitting-room. Here a very
vigorous examination ensued, with the result that
Audrey was promoted to take her place with the
head girls, and Evelyn was conducted to the Fourth
Form. Her companions received her with smiling
eyes and beaming looks. She felt rather cross, however;
and was even more so when the English
teacher, Miss Thompson, set her some work to do.
Evelyn was extremely backward with regard to her
general education. But Miss Sinclair had such
marvelous tact, that, while she instructed the little
girl and gave her lessons which were calculated to
bring out her best abilities, she never let her feel her
real ignorance. At school, however, all this state of
things was reversed. Audrey, calm and dignified,
took a high position in the school; and Evelyn was
simply, in her own opinion, nowhere. A sulky expression
clouded her face. She thought of Jasper’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>
words, and determined that no one should break her
spirit.
</p>
<p>
“You will read over the reign of Edward I., and
I will question you about it when morning school
is over,” said Miss Thompson in a pleasant tone.
“After recreation I will give you your lessons to
prepare for to-morrow. Now, please attend to your
book. You will be able to take your proper place
in class to-morrow.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Thompson as she spoke handed a History
of England to the little girl. The History was dry,
and the reign, in Evelyn’s opinion, not worth reading.
She glanced at it, then turned the book, open
as it was, upside down on her desk, rested her elbows
on it, and looked calmly around her.
</p>
<p>
“Take up your book, Miss Wynford, and read it,”
said Miss Thompson.
</p>
<p>
Evelyn smiled quietly.
</p>
<p>
“I know all about the reign,” she said. “I need
not read the history any more.”
</p>
<p>
The other girls smiled. Miss Thompson thought
it best to take no notice. The work of the school
proceeded; and at last, when recess came, the English
teacher called the little girl to her.
</p>
<p>
“Now I must question you,” she said. “You say
you know the reign of Edward I. Let me hear
what you do know. Stand in front of me, please;
put your hands behind your back. So.”
</p>
<p>
“I prefer to keep my hands where they are,” said
Evelyn.
</p>
<p>
“Do what I say. Stand upright. Now then!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>
</p>
<p>
Miss Thompson began catechizing. Evelyn’s crass
ignorance instantly appeared. She knew nothing
whatever of that special period of English history; indeed,
at that time her knowledge of any history was
practically <em>nil</em>.
</p>
<p>
“I am sorry you told me what was not true with
regard to the reign of Edward I.,” said the governess.
“In this school we are very strict and particular. I
will say nothing further on the matter to-day; but
you will stay here and read over the history during
recess.”
</p>
<p>
“What!” cried Evelyn, her face turning white.
“Am I not to have my recreation?”
</p>
<p>
“Recess only lasts for twenty minutes; you will
have to do without your amusement in the playground
this morning. To-morrow I hope you will
have got through your lessons well and be privileged
to enjoy your pastime with the other pupils.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you know who I am?” began Evelyn.
</p>
<p>
“Yes—perfectly. You are little Evelyn Wynford.
Now be a good girl, Evelyn, and attend to your
work.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Thompson left the room. Evelyn found herself
alone. A wild fury consumed her. She jumped
up.
</p>
<p>
“Does she think for a single moment that I am
going to obey her?” thought the naughty child.
“Oh, if only Jasper were here! Oh Jasper! you
were right; they are trying to break me in, but they
won’t succeed.”
</p>
<p>
A book which the governess had laid upon a table
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>
near attracted the little girl’s attention. It was not
an ordinary lesson-book, but a very beautiful copy of
Ruskin’s <em>Sesame and Lilies</em>. Evelyn took up the
book, opened it, and read the following words on the
title-page:
</p>
<p>
“To dear Agnes, from her affectionate brother
Walter. Christmas Day, 1896.”
</p>
<p>
Quick as thought the angry child tore out the
title-page and two or three other pages at the beginning,
scattered them into little bits, and then,
going up to the fire which burned at one end of the
long room, flung the scattered fragments into the
blaze. She had no sooner done so than a curious
sense of dismay stole over her. She shut up the
book hastily, and being really alarmed, began to look
over her English history. Miss Thompson came
back just before recess was over, picked up Evelyn’s
book, asked her one or two questions, and gave her
an approving nod.
</p>
<p>
“That is better,” she said. “You have done as
much as I could expect in the time. Now then,
come here, please. These are your English lessons
for to-morrow.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn walked quite meekly across the room.
Miss Thompson set her several lessons in the ordinary
English subjects.
</p>
<p>
“And now,” she said, “you are to go to mademoiselle.
She is waiting to find out what French
you know, and to give you your lesson for to-morrow.”
</p>
<p>
The rest of the school hours passed quickly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
Evelyn was given what she considered a disgraceful
amount of work to do; but a dull fear sat at her
heart, and she felt a sense of regret at having torn
the pages out of the volume of Ruskin. Immediately
after morning school the girls went for a short walk,
then dinner was announced, and after dinner there
was a brief period of freedom. Evelyn, Audrey, and
the rest all found themselves walking in the grounds.
Brenda Fox immediately went up to Audrey, and
introduced her to a few of the nicest girls in the
head form, and they all began to pace slowly up and
down. Evelyn stood just for an instant forlorn;
then she dashed into the midst of a circle of little
girls who were playing noisily together.
</p>
<p>
“Stop!” she said. “Look at me, all of you.”
</p>
<p>
The children stopped playing, and looked in
wonder at Evelyn.
</p>
<p>
“I am Evelyn Wynford. Who is going to be my
friend? I shall only take up with the one I really
like. I am not afraid of any of you. I have come
to school to find out if I like it; if I don’t like it I
shall not stay. You had best, all of you, know what
sort I am. It was very mean and horrid to put me
into the Fourth Form with a number of ignorant
little babies; but as I am there, I suppose I shall
have to stay for a week or so.”
</p>
<p>
“You were put into the Fourth Form,” said little
Sophie Jenner, “because, I suppose, you did not
know enough to be put into the Fifth Form.”
</p>
<p>
“You are a cheeky little thing,” said Evelyn,
“and I am not going to trouble myself to reply
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>
to you.—Well, now, who is going to be my friend?
I can tell you all numbers of stories; I have heaps
of pocket-money, and I can bring chocolate-creams
and ginger-pop and all sorts of good things to the
school.”
</p>
<p>
These last remarks were decidedly calculated to
ensure Evelyn’s popularity. Two or three of the
girls ran up to her, and she was soon marching up
and down the playground relating some of her
grievances, and informing them, one and all, of the
high position which lay before her.
</p>
<p>
“You are all very much impressed with Audrey,
I can see, but she is really nobody,” cried Eve.
“By and by Wynford Castle will be mine, and won’t
you like to say you knew me when I am mistress of
the Castle—won’t you just! I do not at all know
that I shall stay long at school, but you had better
make it pleasant for me.”
</p>
<p>
Some of the girls were much impressed, and a few
of them swore eternal fealty to Evelyn. One or two
began to flatter her, and on the whole the little girl
considered that she had a fairly good time during
play-hour. When she got back to her work she was
relieved to see that Ruskin’s <em>Sesame and Lilies</em> no
longer lay in its place on the small table where Miss
Thompson had left it.
</p>
<p>
“She will not open it, perhaps, for years,” thought
Evelyn. “I need not worry any more about that.
And if she did like the book I am glad I tore it.
Horrid, horrid thing!”
</p>
<p>
Lessons went on, and by and by Audrey and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
Evelyn’s first day at school came to an end. The
governess-cart came to fetch them, and they drove
off under the admiring gaze of several of their fellow-pupils.
</p>
<p>
“Well, Evelyn, and how did you like school?”
said Audrey when the two were alone together.
</p>
<p>
“You could not expect me to like it very much,”
replied Evelyn. “I was put into such a horrid low
class. I am angry with Miss Thompson.”
</p>
<p>
“Miss Thompson! That nice, intelligent girl?”
</p>
<p>
“Not much of a girl about her!” said Evelyn.
“Why, she is quite old.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you think so? She struck me as young,
pretty, and very nice.”
</p>
<p>
“It is all very well for you, Audrey; you are so
tame. I really believe you never think a bad
thought of anybody.”
</p>
<p>
“I try not to, of course,” replied Audrey. “Do
you imagine it is a fine trait in one’s character to
think bad thoughts of people?”
</p>
<p>
“Mothery always said that if you did not dislike
people, you were made of cotton-wool,” replied
Evelyn.
</p>
<p>
“Then you really do dislike people?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! some I dislike awfully. Now, there is one
at the Castle—but there! I won’t say any more
about <em>her</em>; and there is one at school whom I hate.
It is that horrid Thompson woman. And she had
the cheek to call me Evelyn.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course she calls you Evelyn; you are her
pupil.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well, I think it is awful cheek, all the same. I
hate her, and—oh, Audrey, such fun—such fun! I
have revenged myself on her; I really have.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh Evelyn! don’t get into mischief, I beseech of
you.”
</p>
<p>
“I sha’n’t say any more, but I do believe that I
have revenged myself. Oh, such fun—such fun!”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn laughed several times during the rest of
her drive home, and arrived at the Castle in high
spirits. The girls were to dine with Lady Frances
and the Squire that evening, as they happened to be
alone; and the Squire was quite interested in the
account which Evelyn gave him of her class.
</p>
<p>
“The only reason why I could read the dull, dull
life of Edward I.,” she said, “is because Edward is
your name, Uncle Ned, and because I love you so
much.”
</p>
<p>
“On the whole, my dear,” said the Squire later on
to his wife, “the school experiment seems to work
well. Little Evelyn was in high spirits to-night.”
</p>
<p>
“You think of no one but Evelyn!” said Lady
Frances. “What about Audrey?”
</p>
<p>
“I am not afraid about Audrey; you have trained
her, and she is by nature most amiable,” said the
Squire.
</p>
<p>
“I am glad you paid me a compliment, my dear,”
answered his wife. “Audrey certainly does credit
to my training. But I trust Miss Henderson will
break that naughty girl in; she certainly needs it.”
</p>
<p>
The next morning the girls went back to school;
and Evelyn, who had quite forgotten what she had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
done to the book, and who had provided herself
secretly with a great packet of delicious sweetmeats
which she intended to distribute amongst her favorites,
was still in high spirits.
</p>
<p>
School began, the girls went to their different
classes, Evelyn stumbled badly through her lessons,
and at last the hour of recess came. The girls were
all preparing to leave the schoolroom when Miss
Thompson asked them to wait a moment.
</p>
<p>
“Something most painful has occurred,” she said,
“and I trust whichever girl has done the mischief
will at once confess it.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn’s face did not change color. A curious,
numb feeling got round her heart; then an obstinate
spirit took possession of her.
</p>
<p>
“Not for worlds will I tell,” she thought. “Of
course Miss Thompson is alluding to the book.”
</p>
<p>
Yes, Miss Thompson was. She held the beautifully
bound copy of Ruskin in her hand, opened it
where the title-page used to be, and with tears in
her eyes looked at the girls.
</p>
<p>
“Some one has torn four pages out of the beginning
of this book,” she said. “I left it here by
mistake yesterday. I took it up this morning to
continue a lecture which I was preparing for the
afternoon, and found what terrible mischief had
been done. I trust whoever has done this will at
least have the honor to confess her wrong-doing.”
</p>
<p>
Silence and expressions of intense dismay were
seen on all the young faces.
</p>
<p>
“If it were my own book I should not mind so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>
much,” said the governess; “but it happens to belong
to Miss Henderson, and was given to her by
her favorite brother, who died two months afterwards.
I had some difficulty in getting her to allow
me to use it for this lecture. Nothing can replace
to her the loss of the inscription written in her
brother’s own hand. The only possible chance for the
guilty person is to tell all at once. But, oh! who
could have been so cruel?”
</p>
<p>
Still the girls were silent, although tears had risen
to many of their eyes. Miss Thompson could hear
the words “Oh, what a shame!” coming from
more than one pair of lips.
</p>
<p>
She waited for an instant, and then said:
</p>
<p>
“I must put a question to each and all of you. I
had hoped the guilty person would confess; but as
it is, I am obliged to ask who has done this mischief.”
</p>
<p>
She then began to question one girl after another
in the class. There were twelve in all in this special
class, and each as her turn came replied in the negative.
Certainly she had not done the mischief;
certainly she had not torn the book. Evelyn’s turn
came last. She replied quietly:
</p>
<p>
“I have not done it. I have not seen the book,
and I have not torn out the inscription.”
</p>
<p>
No one had any reason to doubt her words; and
Miss Thompson, looking very sorrowful, paused for
a minute and then said:
</p>
<p>
“I have asked each of you, and you have all denied
it. I must now question every one else in the school.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
When I have done all that I can I shall have to submit
the matter to Miss Henderson, but I did not
want to grieve her with the news of this terrible loss
until I could at least assure her that the girl who
had done the mischief had repented.”
</p>
<p>
Still there was silence, and Miss Thompson left
the schoolroom. The moment she did so the buzz
of eager voices began, and during the recess that
followed nothing was talked of in the Fourth Form
but the loss which poor Miss Henderson had
sustained.
</p>
<p>
“Poor dear!” said Sophie Jenner; “and she did
love her brother so much! His name was Walter;
he was very handsome. He came once to the school
when first it was started. My sister Rose was here
then, and she said how kind he was, and how he
asked for a holiday for the girls; and Miss Henderson
and Miss Lucy were quite wrapped up in him. Oh,
who could have been so cruel?”
</p>
<p>
“I never heard of such a fuss about a trifle before,”
here came from Evelyn’s lips. “Why, it is only a
book when all is said and done.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you understand?” said Sophie, looking at
her in some astonishment. “It is not a common
book; it is one given to Miss Henderson by the
brother she loved. He is dead now; he can never
give her any other book. That was the very last
present he ever made her.”
</p>
<p>
“Have some lollipops, and try to think of cheerful
things,” said Evelyn; but Sophie turned almost
petulantly away.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>
</p>
<p>
“Do you know,” Sophie said to her special friend,
Cherry Wynne, “I don’t think I like Evelyn. How
funnily she spoke! I wonder, Cherry, if she had
anything to do with the book?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course not,” answered Cherry. “She would
not have dared to utter such a lie. Poor Miss
Henderson! How sorry I am for her!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span><a name='chXVI' id='chXVI'></a>CHAPTER XVI.—SYLVIA’S DRIVE.</h2>
<p>
“I have something very delightful to tell you,
Sylvia,” said her father.
</p>
<p>
He was standing in his cold and desolate sitting-room.
The fire was burning low in the grate.
Sylvia shivered slightly, and bending down, took up
a pair of tongs to put some more coals on the expiring
fire.
</p>
<p>
“No, no, my dear—don’t,” said her father.
“There is nothing more disagreeable than a person
who always needs coddling. The night is quite hot
for the time of year. Do you know, Sylvia, that
I made during the last week a distinct saving. I
allowed you, as I always do, ten shillings for the
household expenses. You managed capitally on
eight shillings. We really lived like fighting-cocks;
and what is nicest of all, my dear daughter, you look
the better in consequence.”
</p>
<p>
Sylvia did not speak.
</p>
<p>
“I notice, too,” continued Mr. Leeson, a still more
satisfied smile playing round his lips, “that you eat
less than you did before. Last night I was pleased
to observe how truly abstemious you were at supper.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
</p>
<p>
“Father,” said Sylvia suddenly, “you eat less and
less; how can you keep up your strength at this
rate? Cannot you see, clever man that you are, that
you need food and warmth to keep you alive?”
</p>
<p>
“It depends absolutely,” replied Mr. Leeson, “on
how we accustom ourselves to certain habits.
Habits, my dear daughter, are the chains which link
us to life, and we forge them ourselves. With good
habits we lead good lives. With pernicious habits
we sink: the chains of those habits are too thick, too
rusty, too heavy; we cannot soar. I am glad to see
that you, my dear little girl, are no longer the victim
of habits of greediness and desire for unnecessary
luxuries.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, father, dinner is ready now. Won’t you
come and eat it?”
</p>
<p>
“Always harping on food,” said Mr. Leeson. “It
is really sad.”
</p>
<p>
“You must come and eat while the things are hot,”
answered Sylvia.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Leeson followed his daughter. He was, notwithstanding
all his words to the contrary, slightly
hungry that morning; the intense cold—although
he spoke of the heat—made him so. He sat down,
therefore, and removed the cover from a dish on
which reposed a tiny chop.
</p>
<p>
“Ah,” he said, “how tempting it looks! We will
divide it, dear. I will take the bone; far be it from
me to wish to starve you, my sweet child.”
</p>
<p>
He took up his knife to cut the chop. As he did
so Sylvia’s face turned white.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
</p>
<p>
“No, thank you,” she said. “It really so happens
that I don’t want it. Please eat it all. And see,”
she continued, with a little pride, lifting the cover
of a dish which stood in front of her own plate; “I
have been teaching myself to cook; you cannot
blame me for making the best of my materials. How
nice these fried potatoes look! Have some, won’t
you, father?”
</p>
<p>
“You must have used something to fry them in,”
said Mr. Leeson, an angry frown on his face. “Well,
well,” he added, mollified by the delicious smell,
which could not but gratify his hungry feelings—“all
right; I will take a few.”
</p>
<p>
Sylvia piled his plate. She played with a few
potatoes herself, and Mr. Leeson ate in satisfied
silence.
</p>
<p>
“Really they are nice,” he said. “I have enjoyed
my dinner. I do not know when I made such a
luxurious meal. I shall not need any supper to-night.”
</p>
<p>
“But I shall,” said Sylvia stoutly. “There will
be supper at nine o’clock as usual, and I hope you
will be present, father.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, my dear, have something very plain. I
am absolutely satisfied for twenty-four hours. And
you, darling—did you make a good meal?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, thank you, father.”
</p>
<p>
“There were a great many potatoes cooked. I
see they are all finished.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, father.”
</p>
<p>
“I am now going back to my sitting-room. I shall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
be engaged for some hours. What are you going
to do, Sylvia?”
</p>
<p>
“I shall go out presently for a walk.”
</p>
<p>
“Is it not rather dangerous for you to wander
about in such deep snow?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I like it, father; I enjoy it. I could not possibly
stay at home.”
</p>
<p>
“Very well, my dear child. You are a good girl.
But, Sylvia dear, it strikes me that we had better
not have any more frying done; it must consume a
great quantity of fuel. Now, that chop might have
been boiled in a small saucepan, and it really would
have been quite as nutritious. And, my dear, there
would have been the broth—the liquor, I mean—that
it had been boiled in; it would have made an excellent
soup with rice in it. I have been lately compiling
some recipes for living what is called the unluxurious
life. When I have completed my little recipes
I will hand them down to posterity. I shall
publish them. I quite imagine that they will have
a large sale, and may bring me in some trifling returns—eh,
Sylvia?”
</p>
<p>
Sylvia made no answer.
</p>
<p>
“My dear,” said her father suddenly, “I have
noticed of late that you are a little extravagant in
the amount of coals you use. It is your only extravagance,
my dear child, so I will not say much
about it.”
</p>
<p>
“But, father, I don’t understand. What do you
mean?”
</p>
<p>
“There is smoke—<em>smoke</em> issuing from the kitchen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
chimney at times when there ought to be none,” said
Mr. Leeson in a severe voice. “But there, dear, I
won’t keep you now. I expect to have a busy afternoon.
I am feeling so nicely after our simple little
lunch, my dear daughter.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Leeson touched Sylvia’s smooth cheek with
his lips, went into the sitting-room, and shut the
door.
</p>
<p>
“The fire must be quite out by now,” she said to
herself. “Poor, poor father! Oh dear! oh dear!
if he discovers that Jasper is here I shall be done for.
Now that I know the difference which Jasper’s presence
makes, I really could not live without her.”
</p>
<p>
She listened for a moment, noticed that all was
still in the big sitting-room (as likely as not her
father had dropped asleep), and then, turning to
her left, went quickly away in the direction of the
kitchen. When she entered the kitchen she locked
the door. There was a clear and almost smokeless
fire in the range, and drawn up close to it was a table
covered with a white cloth; on the table were preparations
for a meal.
</p>
<p>
“Well, Sylvia,” said Jasper, “and how did he enjoy
his chop? How much of it did he give to you,
my dear?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, none at all, Jasper. I pretended I was not
hungry. It was such a pleasure to see him eat it!”
</p>
<p>
“And what about the fried potatoes, love?”
</p>
<p>
“He ate them too with such an appetite—I just
took a few to satisfy him. Do you know, Jasper, he
says that he thinks an abstemious life agrees with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
me. He says that I am looking very well, and that
he is quite sure no one needs big fires and plenty of
food in cold weather—it is simply and entirely a
matter of habit.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! don’t talk to me of him any more,” said
Jasper. “He is the sort of man to give me the
dismals. I cannot tell you how often I dream of
him at night. You are a great deal too good to
him, Sylvia, and that is the truth. But here—here is
our dinner, you poor frozen lamb. Eat now and satisfy
yourself.”
</p>
<p>
Sylvia sat down and ate with considerable appetite
the good and nourishing food which Jasper had provided.
As she did so her bright, clear, dark eyes
grew brighter than ever, and her young cheeks became
full of the lovely color of the damask rose.
She pushed her hair from her forehead, and looked
thoughtfully into the fire.
</p>
<p>
“You feel better, dear, don’t you?” asked Jasper.
</p>
<p>
“Better!” said the young girl. “I feel alive. I
wonder, Jasper, how long it will last.”
</p>
<p>
“Why should it not go on for some time, dear?
I have money—enough, that is, for the present.”
</p>
<p>
“But you are spending your money on me.”
</p>
<p>
“Not at all. You are keeping me and feeding me.
I give you twenty shillings a week, and out of that
you feed me as well as yourself.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, that twenty shillings!” cried Sylvia. “What
riches it seems! The first week I got it I really felt
that I should never, never be able to come to the end
of it. I quite trembled when I was in father’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
presence. I dreaded that he might see the money
lying in my pocket. It seemed impossible that he,
who loves money so much, would not notice it; but
he did not, and now I am almost accustomed to it.
Oh Jasper, you have saved my life!”
</p>
<p>
“It is well to have lived for some good purpose,”
said Jasper in a guarded tone. She looked at the
young girl, and a quick sigh came to her lips.
</p>
<p>
“Do you know,” she said abruptly, “that I mean
to do more than feed you and warm you?”
</p>
<p>
“But what more could you do?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, clothe you, love—clothe you.”
</p>
<p>
“No, Jasper; you must not.”
</p>
<p>
“But I must and will,” said Jasper. “I have
smuggled in all my belongings, and the dear old
gentleman does not know a single bit about it.
Bless you! notwithstanding that Pilot of his, and
the way he himself sneaks about and watches—notwithstanding
all these things, I, Amelia Jasper, am
a match for him. Yes, my dear, my belongings are
in this house, and one of the trunks contains little
Evelyn’s clothes—the clothes she is not allowed to
wear. I mean to alter them, and add to them, and
rearrange them, and make them fit for you, my bonny
girl.”
</p>
<p>
“It is a temptation,” said Sylvia; “but, Jasper
dear, I dare not allow you to do it. If I were to
appear in anything but the very plainest clothes
father would discover there was something up; he
would get into a state of terror, and my life would
not be worth living. When mother was alive she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>
sometimes tried to dress me as I ought to be dressed,
and I remember now a terrible scene and mother’s
tears. There was an occasion when mother gave me
a little crimson velvet frock, and I ran into the
dining-room to father. I was quite small then, and
the frock suited me, and mother was, oh, so proud!
But half an hour later I was in my room, drowned in
tears, and ordered to bed immediately, and the frock
had been torn off my back by father himself.”
</p>
<p>
“The man is a maniac,” said Jasper. “Don’t let
us talk of him. You can dress fine when you are
with me. I mean to have a gay time; I don’t mean
to let the grass grow under my feet. What do you
say to my smuggling in little Eve some day and
letting her have a right jolly time with us two in
this old kitchen?”
</p>
<p>
“But father will certainly, certainly discover it.”
</p>
<p>
“No; I can manage that. The kitchen is far
away from the rest of the house, and with this new
sort of coal there is scarcely any smoke. At night—at
any rate on dark nights—he cannot see even if
there is smoke; and in the daytime I burn this special
coal. Oh, we are safe enough, my dear; you need
have no fear.”
</p>
<p>
Sylvia talked a little longer with Jasper, and then
she ran to her own room to put on her very threadbare
garments preparatory to going out. Yes, she
certainly felt much, much better. The air was keen
and crisp; she was no longer hungry—that gnawing
pain in her side had absolutely ceased; she was
warm, too, and she longed for exercise. A moment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>
or two later, accompanied by Pilot, she was racing
along the snow-covered roads. The splendid color
in her cheeks could not but draw the attention of any
chance passer-by.
</p>
<p>
“What a handsome—what a very handsome girl!”
more than one person said; and it so happened that
as Sylvia was flying round a corner, her great mastiff
gamboling in front of her, she came face to face
with Lady Frances, who was driving to make some
calls in the neighborhood.
</p>
<p>
Lady Frances Wynford was never proof against a
pretty face, and she had seldom seen a more lovely
vision than those dark eyes and glowing cheeks presented
at that moment. She desired her coachman
to stop, and bending forward, greeted Sylvia in quite
an affectionate way.
</p>
<p>
“How do you do, Miss Leeson?” she said. “You
never came to see me after I invited you to do so.
I meant to call on your mother, but you did not
greet my proposal with enthusiasm. How is she,
by the way?”
</p>
<p>
“Mother is dead,” replied Sylvia in a low tone.
The rich color faded slowly from her cheeks, but
she would not cry. She looked full up at Lady
Frances.
</p>
<p>
“Poor child!” said that lady kindly; “you must
miss her. How old are you, Miss Leeson?”
</p>
<p>
“I am just sixteen,” was the reply.
</p>
<p>
“Would you like to come for a drive with me?”
</p>
<p>
“May I?” said the girl in an almost incredulous
voice.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>
</p>
<p>
“You certainly may; I should like to have you.—Johnson,
get down and open the carriage door for
Miss Leeson.—But, oh, my dear, what is to be done
with the dog?”
</p>
<p>
“Pilot will go home if I speak to him,” said Sylvia.—“Come
here, Pilot.”
</p>
<p>
The mastiff strode slowly up.
</p>
<p>
“Go home, dear,” said Sylvia. “Go, and knock
as you know how at the gates, and father will let
you in. Be quick, dear dog; go at once.”
</p>
<p>
Pilot put on a shrewd and wonderfully knowing
expression, cocked one ear a little, wagged his tail a
trifle, glanced at Lady Frances, seemed on the whole
to approve of her, and then turning on his heel,
trotted off in the direction of The Priory.
</p>
<p>
“What a wonderfully intelligent dog, and how
you have trained him!” said Lady Frances.
</p>
<p>
“Yes; he is almost human,” replied Sylvia. “How
nice this is!” she continued as the carriage began
to roll smoothly away. She leant back against her
comfortable cushions.
</p>
<p>
“But you will soon be cold, my dear, in that very
thin jacket,” said Lady Frances. “Let me wrap
this warm fur cloak round you. Oh, yes, I insist; it
would never do for you to catch cold while driving
with me.”
</p>
<p>
Sylvia submitted to the warm and comforting
touch of the fur, and the smile on her young face
grew brighter than ever.
</p>
<p>
“And now you must tell me all about yourself,”
said Lady Frances. “Do you know, I am quite
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>
curious about you—a girl like you living such a
strange and lonely life!”
</p>
<p>
“Lady Frances,” said Sylvia.
</p>
<p>
“Yes my dear; what?”
</p>
<p>
“I am going to say something which may not be
quite polite, but I am obliged to say it. I cannot
answer any of your questions; I cannot tell you
anything about myself.”
</p>
<p>
“Really?”
</p>
<p>
“Not because I mean to be rude, for in many
ways I should like to confide in you; but it would
not be honorable. Do you understand?”
</p>
<p>
“I certainly understand what honor means,” said
Lady Frances; “but whether a child like you is
acting wisely in keeping up an unnecessary mystery
is more than I can tell.”
</p>
<p>
“I would much rather tell you everything about
myself than keep silence, but I cannot speak,” said
Sylvia simply.
</p>
<p>
Lady Frances looked at her in some wonder.
</p>
<p>
“She is a lady when all is said and done,” she
said to herself. “As to poverty, I do not know that
I ever saw any one so badly dressed; the child has
not sufficient clothing to keep her warm. When last
I saw her she was painfully thin, too; she has more
color in her cheeks now, and more flesh on her poor
young bones, so perhaps whoever she lives with is
taking better care of her. I am curious, and I will
not pretend to deny it, but of course I can question
the child no further.”
</p>
<p>
No one could make herself more agreeable than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>
Lady Frances Wynford when she chose. She chatted
now on many matters, and Sylvia soon felt perfectly
at home.
</p>
<p>
“Why, the child, young as she is, knows some of
the ways of society,” thought the great lady. “I
only wish that that miserable little Evelyn was
half as refined and nice as this poor, neglected girl.”
</p>
<p>
Presently the drive came to an end. Sylvia had
not enjoyed herself so much for many a day.
</p>
<p>
“Now, listen, Sylvia,” said Lady Frances: “I
am a very plain-spoken woman; when I say a thing
I mean it, and when I think a thing, as a rule, I say
it. I like you. That I am curious about you, and
very much inclined to wonder who you are and what
you are doing in this place, goes without saying;
but of course I do not want to pry into what you do
not wish to tell me. Your secret is your own, my
dear, and not my affair; but, at the same time, I
should like to befriend you. Can you come to the
Castle sometimes? When you do come it will be
as a welcome guest.”
</p>
<p>
“I do not know how I can come,” replied Sylvia.
She colored, looked down, and her face turned rather
white. “I have not a proper dress,” she added.
“Oh, not that I am poor, but——”
</p>
<p>
Lady Frances looked puzzled. She longed to say,
“I will give you the dress you need,” but there was
something about Sylvia’s face which forbade her.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” she said, “if you can manage the dress
will you come? This, let me see, is Thursday. The
girls are to have a whole holiday on Saturday. Will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>
you spend Saturday with us? Now you must say
yes; I will take no refusal.”
</p>
<p>
Sylvia’s heart gave a bound of pleasure.
</p>
<p>
“Is it right; is it wrong?” she said to herself.
“But I cannot help it,” was her next thought; “I
must have my fun—I must. I do like Audrey so
much! And I like Evelyn too—not, of course, like
Audrey; but I like them both.”
</p>
<p>
“You will come, dear?” said Lady Frances.
“We shall be very pleased to see you. By the way,
your address is——”
</p>
<p>
“The Priory,” said Sylvia hastily. “Oh, please,
Lady Frances, don’t send any message there! If
you do I shall not be allowed to come to you. Yes,
I will come—perhaps never again, but I will come
on Saturday. It is a great pleasure; I do not feel
able to refuse.”
</p>
<p>
“That is right. Then I shall expect you.”
</p>
<p>
Lady Frances nodded to the young girl, told the
coachman to drive home, and the next moment had
turned the corner and was lost to view.
</p>
<p>
“What fun this is!” said Sylvia to herself. “I
wish Pilot were here. I should like to have a race
with him over the snow. Oh, how beautiful is the
world when all is said and done! Now, if only I
had a proper dress to go to the Castle in!”
</p>
<p>
She ran home. Her father was standing on the
steps of the house. His face looked pinched, blue,
and cold; the nourishment of the chop and the fried
potatoes had evidently passed away.
</p>
<p>
“Why, father, you want your tea!” said the girl.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>
“How sorry I am I was not in sooner to get it for
you!”
</p>
<p>
“Tea, tea!” he said irritably. “Always the same
cry—food, nothing but food; the world is becoming
impossible. My dear Sylvia, I told you that I
should not want to eat again to-day. The fact is,
you overfed me at lunch, and I am suffering from a
sort of indigestion—I am really. There is nothing
better for indigestion than hot water; I have been
drinking it sparingly during the afternoon. But
where have you been, dear, and why did you send
Pilot home? The dog made such a noise at the
gate that I went myself to find out what was the
matter.”
</p>
<p>
“I did not want Pilot, so I sent him home,” was
Sylvia’s low reply.
</p>
<p>
“But why so?”
</p>
<p>
She was silent for a moment; then she looked up
into her father’s face.
</p>
<p>
“We agreed, did we not,” she said, “that we both
were to go our own way. You must not question
me too closely. I have done nothing wrong—nothing;
I am always faithful to you and to my mother’s
memory. You must not expect me to tell you
everything, father, for you know you do not tell me
everything.”
</p>
<p>
“Silly child!” he answered. “But there, Sylvia,
I do trust you. And, my dear little girl, know this,
that you are the great—the very greatest—comfort
of my life. I will come in; it is somewhat chilly
this evening.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>
</p>
<p>
Sylvia rushed before her father into his sitting-room,
dashed up to the fire, flung on some bits of
wood and what scraps of coal were left in the coal-hod,
thrust in a torn newspaper, set a match to the
fire she had hastily laid, and before Mr. Leeson
strolled languidly into the room, a cheerful fire was
crackling and blazing up the chimney.
</p>
<p>
“How extravagant——” he began, but when he
saw Sylvia’s pretty face as she knelt on the hearth
the words were arrested on his lips.
</p>
<p>
“The child is very like her mother, and her mother
was the most beautiful woman on earth when I
married her,” he thought. “Poor little Sylvia! I
wonder will she have a happier fate!”
</p>
<p>
He sat down by the fire. The girl knelt by him,
took his cold hands, and rubbed them softly. Her
heart was full; there were tears in her eyes.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span><a name='chXVII' id='chXVII'></a>CHAPTER XVII.—THE FALL IN THE SNOW.</h2>
<p>
The next morning, when the meager breakfast
which Mr. Leeson and his daughter enjoyed together
had come to an end, Sylvia ran off to find
Jasper. She had stayed with her father during
most of the preceding evening, and although she
had gone as usual to drink her chocolate and eat
her bread before going to bed, she had said very
little to Jasper. But she wanted to speak to her
this morning, for she had thoughts in the night, and
those thoughts were driving her to decisive action.
Jasper was standing in the kitchen. She had made
up the fire with the smokeless coal, and it was burning
slowly but steadily. A little, plump chicken lay
on the table; a small piece of bacon was close at
hand. There was also a pile of large and mealy-looking
potatoes and some green vegetables.
</p>
<p>
“Our dinner for to-day,” said Jasper briefly.
</p>
<p>
“Oh Jasper!” answered the girl—“oh, if only
father could have some of that chicken! Do you
know, I do not think he is at all well; he looked so
cold and feeble last night. He really is starving
himself—very much as I starved myself before you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>
came; but he is old and cannot bear it quite so
well. What am I to do to keep him alive?”
</p>
<p>
Jasper looked full at Sylvia.
</p>
<p>
“Do!” she said. “How can a fool be cured of
his folly? That is the question I ask myself. If he
denies himself the necessaries of life, how are you
to give them to him?”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Sylvia, “I manage as best I can by
hardly ever eating in his presence; he does not notice,
particularly at breakfast. He enjoyed his egg
and toast this morning, and really said nothing
about my unwonted extravagance.”
</p>
<p>
“I have a plan in my head,” said Jasper, “which
may or may not come to anything. You know
those few miserable barn-door fowls which your
father keeps just by the shrubbery in that old hen-house?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” replied Sylvia.
</p>
<p>
“Do they ever lay any eggs?”
</p>
<p>
“No.”
</p>
<p>
“I thought not. I wonder a prudent, careful man
like Mr. Leeson should keep them eating their heads
off, so to speak.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, they don’t eat much,” replied Sylvia. “I
got them when father spoke so much about the
wasted potato-skins. I bought them from a gipsy.
I did not know they were so old.”
</p>
<p>
“We must get rid of those fowls,” said Jasper.
“You must tell your father that it is a great waste
of money to keep them; and, my dear, we will give
him fowl to eat for his dinner as long as the old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>
fowls in the shrubbery last. There are ten of them.
I shall sell them—very little indeed we shall get for
them—and he will imagine he is eating them when
he really is consuming a delicate little bird like the
one you and I are going to enjoy for our dinner to-day.”
</p>
<p>
“What fun!” said Sylvia, the color coming into
her cheeks and her eyes sparkling. “You do not
think it is wrong to deceive him, do you?”
</p>
<p>
“Wrong! Bless you! no,” replied Jasper. “And
now, my dear, what is the matter with you? You
look——”
</p>
<p>
“How?” replied Sylvia.
</p>
<p>
“Just as if you were bursting to tell me something.”
</p>
<p>
“I am—I am,” answered Sylvia. “Oh Jasper,
you must help me!”
</p>
<p>
“Of course I will, dear.”
</p>
<p>
“I have resolved to accept your most kind offer.
I will pay you somehow, in some fashion, but if you
could make just one of Evelyn’s frocks fit for me to
wear!”
</p>
<p>
“Ah!” replied Jasper. “Now, I am as pleased
about this as I could be about anything. We will
have more than one, my pretty young miss. But
what do you want it for?”
</p>
<p>
“I am going to do a great, big, dangerous thing,”
replied Sylvia. “If father discovers, things will be
very bad, I am sure; but perhaps he will not discover.
Anyhow, I am not proof against temptation. I met
Lady Frances Wynford.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>
</p>
<p>
“And how does her ladyship look?” asked Jasper—“as
proud as ever?”
</p>
<p>
“She was not proud to me, Jasper; she was quite
nice. She asked me to take a drive with her.”
</p>
<p>
“You took a drive with her ladyship!”
</p>
<p>
“I did indeed; you must treat me with great
respect after this.”
</p>
<p>
Jasper put her arms akimbo and burst into a loud
laugh.
</p>
<p>
“I guess,” she said after a pause, “you looked
just as fine and aristocratic as her ladyship’s own
self.”
</p>
<p>
“I drove in a luxurious carriage, and had a lovely
fur cloak wrapped round me,” replied the girl; “and
Lady Frances was very, very kind, and she has asked
me to spend Saturday at the Castle.”
</p>
<p>
“Saturday! Why, that is to-morrow.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I know it is.”
</p>
<p>
“You are going?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I am going.”
</p>
<p>
“You will see my little Eve to-morrow?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Jasper.”
</p>
<p>
Jasper’s black eyes grew suspiciously bright; she
raised her hand to dash away something which
seemed to dim them for a second, then she said in a
brisk tone:
</p>
<p>
“We have our work cut out for us, for you shall
not go shabby, my pretty, pretty maid. I will soon
have the dinner in order, and——”
</p>
<p>
“But what have you got for father’s dinner?”
</p>
<p>
“A little soup. You can tell him that you boiled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>
his chop in it. It is really good, and I am putting
in lots of pearl barley and rice and potatoes. He
will be ever so pleased, for he will think it cost next
to nothing; but there is a good piece of solid meat
boiled down in that soup, nevertheless.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, thank you, Jasper; you are a comfort to
me.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” replied Jasper, “I always like to do my
best for those who are brave and young and put
upon. You are a very silly girl in some ways, Miss
Sylvia; but you have been good to me, and I
mean to be good to you. Now then, dinner is
well forward, and we will go and search out the
dress.”
</p>
<p>
The rest of the day passed quickly, and with intense
enjoyment as far as Sylvia was concerned.
She had sufficiently good taste to choose the least
remarkable of Evelyn’s many costumes. There was
a rich dark-brown costume, trimmed with velvet of
the same shade, which could be lengthened in the
skirt and let out in the bodice, and which the young
girl would look very nice in. A brown velvet hat
accompanied the costume, with a little tuft of ostrich
feathers placed on one side, and a pearl buckle to
keep all in place. There were muffs and furs in
quantities to choose from. Sylvia would for once
in her life be richly appareled. Jasper exerted
herself to the utmost, and the pretty dress was all
in order by the time night came.
</p>
<p>
It was quite late evening when Sylvia sought the
room where her father lived. A very plain but at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>
the same time nourishing supper had been provided
for Mr. Leeson. Sylvia’s own supper she would take
as usual with Jasper. Sylvia dashed into her father’s
room, her eyes bright and her cheeks glowing. She
was surprised and distressed to see the room empty.
She wondered if her father had gone to his bedroom.
Quickly she rushed up-stairs and knocked at the
door; there was no response. She opened the door
softly and went in. All was cold and icy desolation
within the large, badly furnished room. Sylvia
shivered slightly, and rushed down-stairs again. She
peeped out of the window. The snow was falling
heavily in great big flakes.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I hope it will not snow too much to-night!”
thought the young girl. “But no matter; however
deep it is, I shall find my way to Castle Wynford
to-morrow.”
</p>
<p>
She wondered if her father would miss her, if he
would grow restless and anxious; but nevertheless
she was determined to enjoy her pleasure. Still,
where was he now? She glanced at the fire in the
big grate; she ventured to put on some more coals
and to tidy up the hearth; then she drew down the
blinds of the windows, pulled her father’s armchair
in front of the fire, sat down herself by the hearth,
and waited. She waited for over half an hour.
During that time the warmth of the fire made her
drowsy. She found herself nodding. Suddenly she
sat up wide awake. A queer sense of uneasiness
stole over her; she must go and seek her father.
Where could he be? How she longed to call Jasper
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>
to her aid! But that, she knew, would be impossible.
She wrapped a threadbare cloak, which hung
on a peg in the hall, round her shoulders, slipped
her feet into goloshes, and set out into the wintry
night. She had not gone a dozen yards before she
saw the object of her search. Mr. Leeson was lying
full length on the snow; he was not moving. Sylvia
had a wild horror that he was dead; she bent over
him.
</p>
<p>
“Father! father!” she cried.
</p>
<p>
There was no answer. She touched his face with
her lips; it was icy cold. Oh, was he dead? Oh,
terror! oh, horror! All her accustomed prudence
flew to the winds. Get succor for him at once she
must. She dashed into the kitchen. Jasper was
standing by the fire.
</p>
<p>
“Come at once, Jasper!” she said. “Bring
brandy, and come at once.”
</p>
<p>
“What has happened, my darling?”
</p>
<p>
“Come at once and you will see. Bring brandy—brandy.”
</p>
<p>
Jasper in an emergency was all that was admirable.
She followed Sylvia out into the snow,
and between them they dragged Mr. Leeson back
to the house.
</p>
<p>
“Now, dear,” said Jasper, “I will give him the
brandy, and I’ll stand behind him. When he comes
to I will slip out of the room. Oh, the poor gentleman!
He is as cold as ice. Hold that blanket and
warm it, will you, Sylvia? We must put it round
him. Oh, bless you, child! heap some coals on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>
fire. What matter the expense? There! you cannot
lift that great hod; I’ll do it.”
</p>
<p>
Jasper piled coals on the grate; the fire crackled
and blazed merrily. Mr. Leeson lay like one dead.
</p>
<p>
“He is dead—he is dead!” gasped Sylvia.
</p>
<p>
“No, love, not a bit of it; but he slipped in the
cold and the fall stunned him a bit, and the cold is
so strong he could not come to himself again. He
will soon be all right; we must get this brandy between
his lips.”
</p>
<p>
That they managed to do, and a minute or two
later the poor man opened his eyes. Just for a
second it seemed to him that he saw a strange woman,
stout and large and determined-looking, bending
over him; but the next instant, his consciousness
more wholly returning, he saw Sylvia. Sylvia’s
little face, white with fear, her eyes, large with love
and anxiety, were close to his. He smiled into the
sweet little face, and holding out his thin hand, allowed
her to clasp it. There was a rustle as though
somebody was going away, and Sylvia and her father
were alone. A moment later the young girl raised
her eyes and saw Jasper in the background making
mysterious signs to her. She got up. Jasper was
holding a cup of very strong soup in her hand.
Sylvia took it with thankfulness, and brought it to
her father.
</p>
<p>
“Do you know,” she said, trying to speak as
cheerfully as she could, “that you have behaved
very badly? You went out into the snow when
you should have been in your warm room, and you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>
fell down and you fainted or something. Anyhow,
I found you in time; and now you are to drink
this.”
</p>
<p>
“I won’t; hot water will do—not that expensive
stuff,” said Mr. Leeson, true to the tragedy of his
life even at this crucial moment.
</p>
<p>
“Drink this and nothing else,” said Sylvia, speaking
as hardly and firmly as she dared.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Leeson was too weak to withstand her. She
fed him by spoonfuls, and presently he was well
enough to sit up again.
</p>
<p>
“Child, what a fire!” he said.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, father; and if it means our very last sixpence,
or our very last penny even, it is going to be
a big fire to-night: and you are going to be nursed
and petted and comforted. Oh, father, father, you
gave me such a fright!”
</p>
<p>
As Sylvia spoke her composure gave way; her
tense feelings were relieved by a flood of tears. She
pressed her face against her father’s hand and sobbed
unrestrainedly.
</p>
<p>
“You do not mean to say you are really fond of
me?” he said; and a queer moisture came into his
own eyes. He said nothing more about the coals,
and Sylvia insisted on his having more food, and, in
short, having a really good time.
</p>
<p>
“Dare I leave him to-morrow?” she said to herself.
“He may be very weak after this; and yet—and
yet I cannot give up my great, great fun. My
lovely dress, too, ready and all! Oh! I must go. I
am sure he will be all right in the morning.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>
</p>
<p>
Presently, much to Sylvia’s relief, Mr. Leeson
suggested that he should sleep on the sofa, in the
neighborhood of the big fire.
</p>
<p>
“For you have been so reckless, my dear little
girl,” he said, “that really you have provided a fire
to last for hours and hours. It would be a sad pity
to waste it; I think, therefore, that I shall spend the
night on this sofa, well wrapped up, enjoying the
heat.”
</p>
<p>
“Nothing could be better, father,” said Sylvia,
“except a big, very big, fire in your own room,
and you in your own bed well warmed with hot
bottles.”
</p>
<p>
“We should soon be in the workhouse,” was Mr.
Leeson’s rejoinder. “No, no; I will enjoy the fire
here now that you have been so extravagant;
and you had better go to bed if you have had your
supper.”
</p>
<p>
Sylvia had had no supper, but Mr. Leeson was far
too self-absorbed to notice that fact. Presently she
left him, and he lay on the sofa, blinking into the
fire, and occasionally half-dozing. After a time he
dropped off to sleep, and the young girl, who stole
in to look at him, went out with a satisfied expression
on her face.
</p>
<p>
“He is quite well again,” she said to Jasper, “and
he is sleeping sweetly.
</p>
<p>
“Now, look here,” said Jasper. “What is fretting
you?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t think I ought to leave him to-morrow.”
</p>
<p>
“But I shall be here. I will manage to let him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>
have his meals comfortable without his knowing it.
Do you suppose I have not done more difficult things
than that in my day? Now, my love, you go to bed
and sleep sound, and I will have a plan all mature to
give you your happy day with an undisturbed conscience
in the morning.”
</p>
<p>
Sylvia was really very tired—dead tired. She
went up-stairs, and as soon as she laid her head on her
pillow was sound asleep.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Mr. Leeson slept on for two or three
hours; it was past the middle of the night when he
awoke. He woke wide awake, as elderly people will,
and looked round him. The fire had burnt itself
down to a great red mass; the room looked cheery
and comfortable in the warm rays. Mr. Leeson
stirred himself luxuriously and wrapped the blanket,
which Jasper had brought from her own stores,
tightly round his person. After a time, however,
its very softness and fluffiness and warmth attracted
his attention. He began to feel it between his
fingers and thumb; then he roused himself, sat up,
and looked at it. A suspicious look came into his
eyes.
</p>
<p>
“What is the matter?” he said to himself. “Is
Sylvia spending money that I know nothing about?
Why, this is a new blanket! I have an inventory
of every single thing that this house possesses.
Surely new blankets are not included in that inventory!
I can soon see.”
</p>
<p>
He rose, lit a pair of candles, went to a secretary
which stood against the wall, opened it, and took out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>
a book marked “Exact Inventory of all the Furniture
at The Priory.” He turned up the portion devoted
to house linen, and read the description of the different
blankets which the meager establishment contained.
There was certainly a lack of these valuable
necessaries; the blankets at The Priory had seen
much service, and were worn thin with use and washing.
But this blanket was new—oh, delicious, of
course—but what was the man worth who needed
such luxuries! Mr. Leeson pushed it aside with a
disturbed look on his face.
</p>
<p>
“Sylvia must be spending money,” he said to himself.
“I have observed it of late. She looks better,
and she decidedly gives me extravagant meals. The
bread is not as stale as it might be, and there is too
much meat used. This soup——”
</p>
<p>
He took up the empty cup from which he had
drained the soup a few hours back, and looked at a
drop or two which still remained at the bottom.
</p>
<p>
“Positively it jellies,” he said to himself—“jellies!
Then, too, in my rambles round this evening I noticed
that smoke again—that smoke coming from
the kitchen. There is too much fuel used here, and
these blankets are disgraceful, and the food is reckless—there
is no other word for it.”
</p>
<p>
He sank back on his sofa and gazed at the fire.
</p>
<p>
“Ah!” he said as he looked full at the flames,
“out you go presently; and for some time the
warmth will remain in the room, and I shall not
dream of lighting any other fire here until that
warmth is gone. Sylvia takes after her mother.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>
There was never a better woman than my dear wife,
but she was madly, disgracefully extravagant. What
shall I do if this goes on?—and pretty girls like
Sylvia are apt to be so thoughtless. I wish I could
send her away for a bit; it will be quite terrible if
she develops her mother’s tastes. I could not be
cruel to my pretty little girl, but she certainly will
be a fearful thorn in my side if she buys blankets of
this sort, and feeds me with soup that jellies, forsooth!
What am I to do? I have not saved quite
so much as I ought during the last week. Ah! the
house is silent as the grave. I shall just count out
the money I have put into that last canvas bag.”
</p>
<p>
A stealthy, queer light came into Mr. Leeson’s
eyes. He crossed the room on tiptoe and turned the
key in the lock. As he did so he seemed to be
assailed by a memory.
</p>
<p>
“Was I alone with Sylvia when I awoke out of
unconsciousness,” he said to himself, “or was there
some one else by? I cannot quite make out. Was
it a dream that I saw an ugly, large woman bending
over me? People do dream things of that sort
when they sink from exhaustion. I have read of it
in stories of misers. Misers! I am nothing of that
kind; I am just a prudent man who will not spend
too much—a prudent man who tries to save. It
must have been a dream that a stranger was in the
house; my little girl might take after her mother,
but she is not so bad as that. Yes, I will take the
opportunity; I will count what is in the canvas bag.
I was too weak to-night to attempt the work of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>
burying my treasure, but to-morrow night I must be
stronger. I believe I ate too much, and that is what
ails me—in fact, I am certain of it. The cold took
me and brought on an acute attack of indigestion,
and I stumbled and fell. Poor dear little Sylvia!
But I won’t leave her penniless; that is one comfort.”
</p>
<p>
Putting out one candle carefully, Mr. Leeson now
laid the other on a table. He then went to his
secretary and opened it. He pushed in his hand
far, and brought out from its innermost depths a
small bag made of rough canvas. The bag was tied
with coarse string. He glanced round him, a strange
expression on his face, and loosening the string of
the bag, poured its contents upon the table. He
poured them out slowly, and as he did so a look of
distinct delight visited his face. There lay on the
table in front of him a pile of money—gold, silver,
copper. He spent some time dividing the three
species of coin into different heaps. The gold coins
were put in piles one on top of the other at his
right hand, the silver lying in still larger heaps in
the middle; the coppers, up to farthings, lay on his
left hand. He bent his head and touched the gold
with his lips.
</p>
<p>
“Beautiful! blessed! lovely!” he muttered. “I
have saved all this out of the money which my dear
wife would have spent on food and dress and luxuries.
The solid, tangible, precious thing is here,
and there is more like it—much more like it—many
bags larger than these, full, full to the brim, all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>
buried down deep in the fowl-house. No one would
guess where I bank my spoils. They are as safe
as can be. I dare not keep much treasure in the
house, but no one will know where it really lies.”

He counted his gold carefully; he also counted
his silver; finally he counted his copper. He wrote
down the different sums on a piece of paper, which
he slipped into the canvas bag; he put back the
coins, tied the bag with the string, and returned it
to its hiding-place.
</p>
<p>
“To-morrow night I must bury it,” he said to
himself. “I had hoped that I would have saved a
little more, but by dint of great additional economy
I may succeed next month. Well, I must begin to
be very careful, and I must speak plainly on the
subject to Sylvia.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span><a name='chXVIII' id='chXVIII'></a>CHAPTER XVIII.—A RED GIPSY CLOAK.</h2>
<p>
Mr. Leeson looked quite well the next morning,
and Sylvia ate her scanty breakfast with a happy
heart; she no longer felt any qualms at leaving her
father for the day. Jasper assured Sylvia over and
over again that all would be well; that without in
the least betraying the secret of her residence in
the house, she would see to Mr. Leeson’s comforts.
The difficulty now was for Sylvia to dress in her
smart clothes and slip away without her father seeing
her. She did not want to get to Castle Wynford
much before one o’clock, but she would leave
The Priory long before that hour and wander about
in her usual fashion. No outdoor exercise tired
this energetic girl. She looked forward to a whole
long day of unalloyed bliss, to the society of other
girls, to congenial warmth and comfort and luxury.
She even looked forward with a pleasure, that her
father would put down to distinct greediness, to
nice, temptingly served meals. Oh yes, she meant
to enjoy everything. She meant to drink this cup of
bliss to the bottom, not to leave one drop untasted.
Jasper seemed to share her pleasure. Jasper burdened
her with many messages to Evelyn; she got
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>
Sylvia to promise that she would contrive a meeting
between Evelyn and her old maid on the following
day. Jasper selected the rendezvous, and told
Sylvia exactly what she was to say to Evelyn.
</p>
<p>
“Whatever happens, I must see her,” said the
woman. “Tell her there are many reasons; and
tell her too that I am hungry for a sight of her—hungry,
hungry.”
</p>
<p>
“Because you love her so much,” said Sylvia, a
soft light in her eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, my darling, that is it—I love her.”
</p>
<p>
“And she must love you very much,” said Sylvia.
</p>
<p>
Jasper uttered a quick sigh.
</p>
<p>
“It is not Evelyn’s way to love to extremities,”
she said slowly. “You must not blame her, my
dear; we are all made according to the will of the
Almighty; and Evelyn—oh yes, she is as the apple
of the eye to me, but I am nothing of that sort to
her. You see, dear, her head is a bit turned with
the lofty future that lies before her. In some ways
it does not suit her; it would suit you, Miss Sylvia,
or it would suit Miss Audrey, but it does not suit
little Eve. It is too much for my little Eve; she
would do better in a less exalted sphere.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I do hope and trust she will be glad to
see you and glad to hear about you,” said Sylvia.
“I will be sure to tell her what a dear old thing
you are. But, oh, Jasper, do you think she will
notice the smart dress made out of her dress?”
</p>
<p>
“You can give her this note, dear; I am sending
her a word of warning not to draw attention to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>
your dress. And now, don’t you think you had
better get into it, and let me see you out by the
back premises?”
</p>
<p>
“I must go and see father just for a minute first,”
said Sylvia.
</p>
<p>
She ran off, saw her father, as usual busily writing
letters, and bent down to kiss him.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t disturb me,” he said in a querulous tone.
“I am particularly busy. The post this morning has
brought me some gratifying news. A little investment
I made a short time ago in great fear and
trembling has turned up trumps. I mean to put a
trifle more money—oh, my dear! I only possess a
trifle—into the same admirable undertaking (gold-mines,
my dear), and if all that the prospectus says
is true I shall be in very truth a rich man. Not yet,
Sylvia—don’t you think it—but some day.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh father! and if you are——”
</p>
<p>
“Why, you may spend a little more then, dear—a
little more; but it is wrong to squander gold.
Gold is a beautiful and precious thing, my dear;
very beautiful, very precious, very hard to get.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, father; and I hope you will have a great
deal of it, and I hope you will put plenty—plenty
of money into the—into the——”
</p>
<p>
“Investment,” said Mr. Leeson. “The investment
that sounds so promising. Don’t keep me now,
love.”
</p>
<p>
“I am going out for a long walk, father; it is
such a bright, sunshiny day. Good-by for the present.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>
</p>
<p>
Mr. Leeson did not hear; he again bent over the
letter which he was writing. Sylvia ran back to
Jasper.
</p>
<p>
“He seems quite well,” she said, “and very much
interested in what the post brought him this morning.
I think I can leave him quite safely. You
will be sure to see that he has his food.”
</p>
<p>
“Bless you, child!—yes.”
</p>
<p>
“And you will on no account betray that you
live here?”
</p>
<p>
“Bless you, child! again—not I.”
</p>
<p>
“Well then, I will get into my finery. How
grand and important I shall feel!”
</p>
<p>
So Sylvia was dressed in the brown costume and
the pretty brown velvet hat, and she wore a little
sable collar and a sable muff; and then she kissed
Jasper, and telling her she would remember all the
messages, started on her day of pleasure. Jasper
saw her out by the back entrance. This entrance
had been securely closed before Jasper’s advent, but
between them the woman and the girl had managed
to open the rusty gate, although Mr. Leeson was
unaware that it had moved on its hinges for many
a long day. It opened now to admit of Sylvia’s
exit, and Jasper went slowly back to the house,
meditating as she did so. Whatever her meditations
were, they roused her to action. She engaged herself
busily in her bedroom and kitchen. She opened
her trunk and took out a small bag which contained
her money. She had plenty of money, still, but it
would not last always. Without Sylvia’s knowing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>
it, she had often spent more than a pound a week on
this establishment. It had been absolutely necessary
for her to provide herself with warm bedclothes, and
to add to the store of coals by purchasing anthracite
coal, which is almost smokeless. In one way or
another her hoard was diminished by twenty pounds;
she had therefore only forty more. When this sum
was spent she would be penniless.
</p>
<p>
“Not that I am afraid,” thought Jasper, “for
Evelyn will have to give me more money—she must.
I could not leave my dear little Sylvia now that I find
the dreadful plight she is in; and I cannot stay far
from my dear Evelyn, for although she does not love
me as I love her, still, I should suffer great pain if I
could not be, so to speak, within call. I wonder if
my plan will succeed. I must have a try.”
</p>
<p>
Jasper, having fulfilled her small duties, sat for a
time gazing straight before her. The hours went on.
The little carriage clock which she kept in her bedroom
struck eleven, then twelve.
</p>
<p>
“Time for him to have something,” thought Jasper.
“Now, can I possibly manage? Yes, I think
so.”
</p>
<p>
She took a saucepan, which held something mysterious,
out into the open air. It was an old, shabby
saucepan. She hid it in the shrubbery. She then
went back to her room and changed her dress. She
was some little time over her toilet, and when she
once more emerged into view, the old Jasper, to all
appearance, had vanished.
</p>
<p>
A dark, somewhat handsome woman, in a faded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>
red gipsy cloak, now stood before the looking-glass.
Jasper slipped out the back way, pushed aside the
rusty gate, said a friendly word to Pilot, who wagged
his tail with approbation, and carrying a basket
on her arm, walked slowly down the road. She met
one or two people, and accosted them in the true
Romany style.
</p>
<p>
“May I tell your fortune, my pretty miss? May
I cross your hand with silver and tell you of the fine
gentleman who is going to ride by presently? Let
me, my dear—let me.”
</p>
<p>
And when the young girl she addressed ran away
giggling, little suspecting that Jasper was not a real
gipsy, Jasper knew that her scheme had succeeded.
She even induced a village boy to submit to her
fortune-telling, and half-turned his head by telling
him of a treasure to be found, and a wife in an
upper class who would raise him once for all to a
position of luxury. She presently pounded loudly on
The Priory gates. Mr. Leeson had an acute ear;
he always sat within view of these gates. His one
desire was to keep all strangers from the premises;
he had trained Pilot for the purpose. Accordingly
Jasper’s knocks were not heeded. Sylvia was always
desired to go to the village to get the necessary food;
trades-people were not allowed on the premises. His
letter occupied him intently; he was busy, too, looking
over files of accounts and different prospectuses;
he was engaged over that most fascinating pastime,
counting up his riches. But, ah! ah! how poor he
was! Oh, what a poverty-stricken man! He sighed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>
and grumbled as he thought over these things.
Jasper gave another furious knock, and finding that
no attention was paid to her imperious summons,
she pushed open the gate. Pilot immediately, as his
custom was, appeared on guard. He stood in front
of Jasper and just for a moment barked at her, but
she gave him a mysterious sign, and he wagged his
tail gently, went up to her, and let her pat him on
the head. The next instant, to Mr. Leeson’s disgust,
the gipsy and the dog were walking side by side up
to the door. He sprang to his feet, and in a moment
was standing on the steps.
</p>
<p>
“Go away, my good woman; go away at once.
I cannot have you on the premises. I will set the
dog on you if you don’t go away.”
</p>
<p>
“One minute, kind sir,” whined Jasper. “I have
come to know if you have any fowls to sell. I want
some fowls; old hens and cocks—not young pullets
or anything of that sort. I want to buy them, sir,
and I am prepared to give a good price.”
</p>
<p>
These extraordinary remarks aroused Mr. Leeson’s
thoughtful attention. He had long been annoyed
by the barn-door fowls, and they were decidedly
old. He had often wished to dispose of them;
they were too tough to eat, and they no longer laid
eggs.
</p>
<p>
“If you will promise to take the fowls right away
with you now, I do not mind selling them for a good
price,” he said. “Are you prepared to give a good
price? I wonder where my daughter is; she would
know better than I what they are worth. Stand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>
where you are, my good woman; do not attempt
to move or the dog Pilot will fly at your throat. I
will call my daughter.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Leeson went into the house and shouted for
Sylvia. Of course there was no answer.
</p>
<p>
“I forgot,” muttered Mr. Leeson. “Sylvia is out.
Really that child over-exercises; such devotion to
the open air must provoke unnecessary appetite. I
wish that horrid gipsy would go away! How extraordinary
that Pilot did not fly at her! But they
say gipsies have great power over men and animals.
Well, if she does give a fair price for the birds I
may as well be quit of them; they annoy me a good
deal, and some time, in consequence of them, some
one may discover my treasure. Good heavens, how
awful! The thought almost unmans me.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Leeson therefore came out and spoke in
quite a civil tone for him.
</p>
<p>
“If you will accompany me to the fowl-house I
will show you the birds, but I may as well say at
once that I won’t give them for a mere nothing,
old as they are—and I should be the last to deceive
you as to their age. They are of a rare kind, and
interesting from a scientific point of view.”
</p>
<p>
“I do not know about scientific fowls,” replied
the gipsy, “but I want to buy a few old hens to put
into my pot.”
</p>
<p>
“Eh?” cried Mr. Leeson in a tone of interrogation.
“Have you a recipe for boiling down old
fowls?”
</p>
<p>
“Have not I, your honor! And soon they are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>
done, too—in a jiffy, so to speak. But let me look
at them, your honor, and I will pay you far more
than any one else would give for them.”
</p>
<p>
“You won’t get them unless you give a very good
sum. You gipsies, if the truth were known, are all
enormously rich.”
</p>
<p>
He walked round to the hen-house, accompanied
by the supposed gipsy and Pilot. The fowls, about
a dozen in number, were strutting up and down their
run. They were hungry, poor creatures, for they
had had but a slight meal that morning. The gipsy
pretended to bargain for them, keeping a sharp eye
all the time on Mr. Leeson.
</p>
<p>
“This one,” she said, catching the most disreputable-looking
of the birds, “is the one I want for the
gipsies’ stew. There, I will give you ninepence for
this bird.”
</p>
<p>
“Ninepence!” cried Mr. Leeson, almost shrieking
out the word. “Do you think I would sell a valuable
hen like that for ninepence? And you say it
can be boiled down to eat tender!”
</p>
<p>
“Boiled down to eat tender!” said the supposed
gipsy. “Why, it can be made delicious. There is
broth in it, soup in it, and meat in it. There is dinner
for four, and supper for four, and soup for four
in this old hen!”
</p>
<p>
“And you offer me ninepence for such a valuable
bird! I tell you what: I wish you would show me
that recipe. I will give you sixpence for it. I do
not know how to make an old hen tender.”
</p>
<p>
“Give me a quarter of an hour, your honor, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span>
you will not know that you are not eating the
youngest chicken in the land.”
</p>
<p>
“But how are you to cook it?”
</p>
<p>
“I will make a bit of fire in the shrubbery, and
do it by a recipe of my own.”
</p>
<p>
“You are sure you will not go near the house?”
</p>
<p>
“No, your honor.”
</p>
<p>
“But how can a fowl that is now alive be fit to
eat in a quarter of an hour?”
</p>
<p>
“It is a recipe of my grandmother’s, your honor,
and I am not going to give it until you taste what
the bird is like. Now, if you will go away I will
get it ready for you.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Leeson really felt interested.
</p>
<p>
“What a sensible woman!” he said to himself.
“I shall try and get that recipe out of her for threepence;
it will be valuable for my little book of
cheap recipes; it would probably sell the book. How
to make four dinners, four lunches, and four plates
of soup out of an old hen. A most taking recipe—most
taking!”
</p>
<p>
He walked up and down while the pretended
gipsy heated up the stew she had already made out
of a really tender chicken. The poor old hen was
tied up so that she could not cackle or make any
sound, and put into the bottom of the supposed
gipsy’s basket; and presently Jasper appeared carrying
the stew in a cracked basin.
</p>
<p>
“Here, your honor, eat it up before me, and tell
me afterwards if a better or a more tender fowl ever
existed.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>
</p>
<p>
It was in this way that Mr. Leeson made an excellent
repast. He was highly pleased, for decidedly
the boniest and most scraggy of the fowls had been
selected, and nothing could be more delicious than
this stew. He fetched a plate and knife and fork
from his sitting-room, where he always kept a certain
amount of useful kitchen utensils, ate his dinner,
pronounced it to be the best of the best, and desired
the gipsy to leave the balance in the porch.
</p>
<p>
“Thank you,” he said; “it is admirable. And
so you really made that out of my old hen in a few
minutes? I will give you threepence if you will
give me the recipe.”
</p>
<p>
“I could not sell it for threepence, sir—no, not for
sixpence; no, not for a shilling. But I should like
to make a bargain for the rest of the fowls.”
</p>
<p>
“How much will you give for each?”
</p>
<p>
“Taking them all in a heap, I will give sixpence
apiece,” replied the gipsy.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Leeson uttered a scream.
</p>
<p>
“You have outdone yourself, my good woman,”
he said. “Do you think I am going to give fowls
that will make such delicious and nourishing food
away for that trivial sum? My little daughter is a
very clever cook, and I shall instruct her with
regard to the serving up of the remainder of my
poultry. If you will not give me the recipe I must
ask you to go.”
</p>
<p>
The gipsy pretended to be extremely angry.
</p>
<p>
“I won’t go,” she said, “unless you allow me to tell
you your fortune; I won’t stir, and that’s flat.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>
</p>
<p>
“I do not believe in gipsy fortune-tellers. I shall
have to call the police if you do not leave my
establishment immediately.”
</p>
<p>
“And how will you manage when you don’t ever
leave your own grounds? I am thinking it may be
you are a bit afraid. People who stick so close to
home often have a reason.”
</p>
<p>
This remark frightened Mr. Leeson very much.
He was always in terror lest some one would guess
that he kept his treasure on the premises.
</p>
<p>
“Look here,” he said, raising his voice. “You
see before you the poorest man for my position in
the whole of England; it is with the utmost difficulty
that I can keep soul and body together.
Observe the place; observe the house. Do you
think I should care for a recipe to make old fowls
tender if I were not in very truth a most poverty-stricken
person?”
</p>
<p>
“I will tell you if you show me your palm,” said
the gipsy.
</p>
<p>
Now, Mr. Leeson was superstitious. It was the
last thing he credited himself with, but nevertheless
he was. The gipsy, with her dancing black eyes,
looked full at him. He had a shadowy, almost a
fearful idea that he had seen that face before—he
could not make out when. Then it occurred to him
that this was the very face that had bent over him
for an instant the night before when he was coming
back from his fit of unconsciousness. Oh, it was
impossible that the gipsy could have been here
then! Had he seen her in a sort of vision? He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>
felt startled and alarmed. The gipsy kept watching
him; she seemed to be reading him through and
through.
</p>
<p>
“I saw you in a dream,” she said. “And I know
you will show your hand; and I know I have things
to tell you, both good and bad.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, well!” said Mr. Leeson, “here is sixpence.
Tell me your gibberish, and then go.”
</p>
<p>
The gipsy looked twice at the coin.
</p>
<p>
“It is a poor one,” she said. “But them who is
rich always give the smallest.”
</p>
<p>
“I am not rich, I tell you.”
</p>
<p>
“They who are rich find it hardest to part with
their pelf. But I will take it.”
</p>
<p>
“I will give you a shilling if you’ll go. But it is
hard for a very poor man to part with it.”
</p>
<p>
“Sixpence will do,” said the gipsy, with a laugh.
“Give it me. Now show me your palm.”
</p>
<p>
She pretended to look steadily into the wrinkled
palm of the miser’s hand, and then spoke.
</p>
<p>
“I see here,” she said, “much wealth. Yes, just
where this cross lies is gold. I also see poverty. I
also see a very great loss and a judgment.”
</p>
<p>
“Go!” screamed the angry man. “Do not tell
me another word.”
</p>
<p>
He dashed into the house in absolute terror, and
banged the hall door after him.
</p>
<p>
“I said I would give him a fright,” said Jasper
to herself. “Well, if he don’t touch another morsel
till Miss Sylvia comes home late to-night, he won’t
die after my dinner. Ah, the poor old hen! I must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>
get her out of the basket now or she will be suffocated.”
</p>
<p>
The gipsy walked slowly down the path, let herself
out by the front entrance, walked round to the
back, got in once more, and handed the old hen to
a boy who was standing by the hedge.
</p>
<p>
“There,” she said. “There’s a present for you.
Take it at once and go.”
</p>
<p>
“What do I want with it?” he asked in astonishment.
“Why, it belongs to old Mr. Leeson, the
miser!”
</p>
<p>
“Go—go!” she said. “You can sell it for sixpence,
or a shilling, or whatever it will fetch, only
take it away.”
</p>
<p>
The boy ran off laughing, the hen tucked under
his arm.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span><a name='chXIX' id='chXIX'></a>CHAPTER XIX.—“WHY DID YOU DO IT?”</h2>
<p>
Meanwhile Sylvia was thoroughly enjoying herself.
She started for the Castle in the highest
spirits. Her walk during the morning hours had
not fatigued her; and when, soon after twelve
o’clock, she walked slowly and thoughtfully up the
avenue, a happier, prettier girl could scarcely be
seen. The good food she had enjoyed since Jasper
had appeared on the scene had already begun to tell.
Her cheeks were plump, her eyes bright; her somewhat
pale complexion was creamy in tint and
thoroughly healthy. Her dress, too, effected wonders.
Sylvia would look well in a cotton frock; she
would look well as a milkmaid, as a cottage girl;
but she also had that indescribable grace which would
enable her to fill a loftier station. And now, in her
rich furs and dark-brown costume, she looked fit to
move in any society. She held Evelyn’s letter in
her hand. Her one fear was that Evelyn would
remark on her own costume transmogrified for
Sylvia’s benefit.
</p>
<p>
“Well, if she does, I don’t much care,” thought
the happy girl. “After all, truth is best. Why
should I deceive? I deceived when I was here
last, when I wore Audrey’s dress. I had not the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>
courage then that I have now. Somehow to-day I
feel happy and not afraid of anything.”
</p>
<p>
She was met, just before she reached the front
entrance, by Audrey and Evelyn.
</p>
<p>
“Here, Evelyn,” she cried—“here is a note for
you.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn took it quickly. She did not want
Audrey to know that Jasper was living at The
Priory. She turned aside and read her note, and
Audrey devoted herself to Sylvia. Audrey had
liked Sylvia before; she liked her better than ever
now. She was far too polite to glance at her
improved dress; that somehow seemed to tell her
that happier circumstances had dawned for Sylvia,
and a sense of rejoicing visited her.
</p>
<p>
“I am so very glad you have come!” she said.
“Evelyn and I have been planning how we are to
spend the day. We want to give you, and ourselves
also, a right good time. Do you know that
Evelyn and I are schoolgirls now? Is it not
strange? Dear Miss Sinclair has left us. We miss
her terribly; but I think we shall like school-life—eh,
Eve?”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn had finished Jasper’s letter, and had
thrust it into her pocket.
</p>
<p>
“I hate school-life!” she said emphatically.
</p>
<p>
“Oh Eve! but why?” asked Audrey. “I thought
you were making a great many friends at school.”
</p>
<p>
“Wherever I go I shall make friends,” replied
Evelyn in a careless tone. “That, of course, is due
to my position. But I do not know, after all,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span>
she continued, “that I like fair-weather friends.
Mothery used to tell me that I must be careful when
with them. She said they would, one and all,
expect me to do something for them. Now, I hate
people who want you to do things for them. For
my part, I shall soon let my so-called friends
know that I am not that sort of girl.”
</p>
<p>
“Let us walk about now,” said Audrey. “It will
be lunch-time before long; afterwards I thought we
might go for a ride. Can you ride, Sylvia?”
</p>
<p>
“I used to ride once,” she answered, coloring high
with pleasure.
</p>
<p>
“I can lend you a habit; and we have a very nice
horse—quite quiet, and at the same time spirited.”
</p>
<p>
“I am not afraid of any horses,” answered the
girl. “I should like a ride immensely.”
</p>
<p>
“We will have lunch, then a ride, then a good
cozy chat together by the schoolroom fire, then
dinner; and then, what do you say to a dance?
We have asked some young friends to come to the
Castle to-night for the purpose.”
</p>
<p>
“I must not be too late in going home,” said
Sylvia. “And,” she added, “I have not brought a
dress for the evening.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, we must manage that,” said Audrey.
“What a good thing that you and I are the same
height! Now, shall we walk round the shrubbery?”
</p>
<p>
“The shrubbery always reminds me,” said Sylvia,
“of the first day we met.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. I was very angry with you that day,”
said Audrey, with a laugh. “You must know that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>
I always hated that old custom of throwing the
Castle open to every one on New Year’s Day.”
</p>
<p>
“But I am too glad of it,” said Sylvia. “It made
me know you, and Evelyn too.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t forget, Audrey,” said Evelyn at that
moment, “that Sylvia is really my friend. It was
I who first brought her to the Castle.—You do not
forget that, do you, Sylvia?”
</p>
<p>
“No,” said Sylvia, smiling. “And I like you both
awfully. But do tell me about your school—do,
please.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Audrey, “there is a rather exciting
thing to tell—something unpleasant, too. Perhaps
you ought not to know.”
</p>
<p>
“Please—please tell me. I am quite dying to hear
about it.”
</p>
<p>
Audrey then described the mysterious damage
done to <span class='sc'>Sesame and Lilies</span>.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Henderson was told,” she said, “and yesterday
morning she spoke to the entire school. She
is going to punish the person who did it very severely
if she can find her; and if that person does not
confess, I believe the whole school is to be put more
or less into Coventry.”
</p>
<p>
“But how does she know that any of the girls
did it?” was Sylvia’s answer. “There are servants
in the house. Has she questioned them?”
</p>
<p>
“She has; but it so happens that the servants are
quite placed above suspicion, for the book was
whole at a certain hour the very first day we came
to school, and that evening it was found in its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span>
mutilated condition. During all those hours it happened
to be in the Fourth Form schoolroom.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Evelyn in a careless tone. “It is quite
horrid for me, you know, for I am a Fourth Form
girl. I ought not to be. I ought to be in the Sixth
Form with Audrey. But there! those unpleasant
mistresses have no penetration.”
</p>
<p>
“But why should you wish to be in a higher form
than your acquirements warrant?” replied Sylvia.
“Oh,” she added, with enthusiasm, “don’t I envy
you both your luck! Should I not love to be at
school in order to work hard!”
</p>
<p>
“By the way, Sylvia,” said Audrey suddenly,
“how have you been educated?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, anyhow,” said the girl. “I have taught
myself mostly. But please do not ask me any questions.
I don’t want to think of my own life at all
to-day; I am so very happy at being with you
two.”
</p>
<p>
Audrey immediately turned the conversation; but
soon, by a sort of instinct, it crept back again to the
curious occurrence which had taken place at Miss
Henderson’s school.
</p>
<p>
“Please do not speak of it at lunch,” said Audrey,
“for we have not told mother or father anything
about it. We hope that this disgraceful thing will
not be made public, but that the culprit will confess.”
</p>
<p>
“Much chance of that!” said Evelyn; and she
nudged Sylvia’s arm, on which she happened to be
leaning.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span>
</p>
<p>
The girls presently went into the house. Lunch
followed. Lady Frances was extremely kind to
Sylvia—in fact, she made a pet of her. She looked
with admiration at the pretty and suitable costume,
and wondered in her own heart what she could do
for the little girl.
</p>
<p>
“I like her,” she said to herself. “She suits me
better than any girl I have ever met except my own
dear Audrey. Oh, how I wish she were the heiress
instead of Evelyn!”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn was fairly well behaved; she had learnt to
suppress herself. She was now outwardly dutiful to
Lady Frances, and was, without any seeming in the
matter, affectionate to her uncle. The Squire was
always specially kind to Evelyn; but he liked young
girls, and took notice of Sylvia also, trying to draw
her out. He spoke to her about her father. He told
her that he had once known a distinguished man of
the name, and wondered if it could be the same.
Sylvia colored painfully, and showed by many signs
that the conversation distressed her.
</p>
<p>
“It cannot be the same, of course,” said the Squire
lightly, “for my friend Robert Leeson was a man
who was likely to rise to the very top of his profession.
He was a barrister of extreme eminence. I
shall never forget the brilliant way he spoke in a
<em>cause célèbre</em> which occupied public attention not
long ago. He won the case for his clients, and covered
himself with well-earned glory.”
</p>
<p>
Sylvia’s eyes sparkled; then they grew dim with
unshed tears. She lowered her eyes and looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span>
on her plate. Lady Frances nodded softly to herself.
</p>
<p>
“The same—doubtless the same,” she said to herself.
“A most distinguished man. How terribly
sad! I must inquire into this; Edward has unexpectedly
given me the clue.”
</p>
<p>
The girls went for a ride after lunch, and the rest
of the delightful day passed swiftly. Sylvia counted
the hours. Whenever she looked at the clock her
face grew a little sadder. Half-hour after half-hour
of the precious time was going by. When should
she have such a grand treat again? At last it was
time to go up-stairs to dress for dinner.
</p>
<p>
“Now, you must come to my room, Sylvia,” said
Evelyn. “Yes, I insist,” she added, “for I was in
reality your first friend.”
</p>
<p>
Sylvia was quite willing to comply. She soon
found herself in Evelyn’s extremely pretty blue-and-silver
room. How comfortable it looked—how
luxurious, how sweet, how refreshing to the eyes!
The cleanliness and perfect order of the room, the
brightness of the fire, the calm, proper look of Read
as she stood by waiting to dress Evelyn for dinner,
all impressed Sylvia.
</p>
<p>
“I like this life,” she said suddenly. “Perhaps
it is bad for me even to see it, but I like it; I confess
as much.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps, Miss Leeson,” said Read just then in a
very courteous voice, “you will not object to Miss
Audrey lending you the same dress you wore the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span>
last time you were here? It has been nicely made
up, and looks very fresh and new.”
</p>
<p>
As Read spoke she pointed to the lovely Indian
muslin robe which lay across Evelyn’s bed.
</p>
<p>
“Please, Read,” said Evelyn suddenly, “don’t
stay to help me to dress to-night; Sylvia will do that.
I want to have a chat with her; I have a lot to
say.”
</p>
<p>
“I will certainly help Evelyn if I can,” replied
Sylvia.
</p>
<p>
“Very well, miss,” replied Read. “To tell you
the truth, I shall be rather relieved; my mistress
requires a fresh tucker to be put into the dress she
means to wear this evening, and I have not quite
finished it. Then you will excuse me, young ladies.
If you want anything, will you have the goodness to
ring?”
</p>
<p>
The next moment Read had departed.
</p>
<p>
“Now, that is right,” said Evelyn. “Now we
shall have a cozy time; there is nearly an hour before
we need go down-stairs. How do you like my
room, Sylvia?”
</p>
<p>
“Very much indeed. I see the second bed has
gone.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh yes. I do not mind a scrap sleeping alone
now; in fact, I rather prefer it. Sylvia, I want so
badly to confide in you!”
</p>
<p>
“To confide in me! How? Why?”
</p>
<p>
“I want to ask you about Jasper. Oh yes, she
wants to see me. I can manage to slip out about
nine o’clock on Tuesday next; we are not to dine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250'></a>250</span>
down-stairs on Tuesday night, for there is a big dinner
party. She can come to meet me then; I shall be
standing by the stile in the shrubbery.”
</p>
<p>
“But surely Lady Frances will not like you to be
out so late!”
</p>
<p>
“As if I minded her! Sylvia, for goodness’ sake
don’t tell me that you are growing goody-goody.”
</p>
<p>
“No; I never was that,” replied Sylvia. “I don’t
think I could be; it is not in me, I am afraid.”
</p>
<p>
“I hope not; I don’t think Jasper would encourage
that sort of thing. Yes, I have a lot to tell her,
and you may say from me that I don’t care for
school.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I am so sorry! It is incomprehensible to
me, for I should think that you would love it.”
</p>
<p>
“For some reasons I might have endured it; but
then, you see, there is that awkward thing about the
Ruskin book.”
</p>
<p>
“The Ruskin book!” said Sylvia. She turned
white, and her heart began to beat. “Surely—surely,
Evelyn, you have had nothing to do with the
tearing out of the first pages of <em>Sesame and Lilies</em>!”
</p>
<p>
“You won’t tell—you promise you won’t tell?”
said Evelyn, nodding her head, and her eyes looking
very bright.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! I don’t know. This is dreadful; please
relieve my anxiety.”
</p>
<p>
“You will not tell; you dare not!” said Evelyn,
with passion. “If you did I would tell about Jasper—I
would. Oh! I would not leave a stone unturned
to make your life miserable. There, Sylvia, forgive
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251'></a>251</span>
me; I did not mean to scold. I like you so much,
dear Sylvia; and I am so glad you have Jasper with
you, and it suits me to perfection. But I did tear
the leaves out of the book; yes, I did, and I am glad
I did; and you must never, never tell.”
</p>
<p>
“But, Eve—oh, Eve! why did you do such a
dreadful thing?”
</p>
<p>
“I did it in a fit of temper, to spite that horrid
Miss Thompson; I hate her so! She was so intolerably
cheeky; she made me stay in during recreation
on the very first day, and she accused me of telling
lies, and when she had left the room I saw the odious
book lying on the table. I had seen her reading it
before, and I thought it was her book; and almost
before I had time to think, the pages were out and
torn up and in the fire. If I had known it was Miss
Henderson’s book, of course, I should not have done
it. But I did not know. I meant to punish horrid
old Thompson, and it seems I have succeeded better
than I expected.”
</p>
<p>
“But, Eve—Eve, the whole school is suspected
now. What are you going to do?”
</p>
<p>
“Do!” replied Evelyn. “Nothing.”
</p>
<p>
“But you have been asked, have you not,
whether you knew anything about the injury to
the book?”
</p>
<p>
“I have, and I told a nice little whopper—a nice
pretty little whopper—a dear, charming little whopper—and
I mean to stick to it.”
</p>
<p>
“Eve!”
</p>
<p>
“You look shocked. Well, cheer up; it has not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252'></a>252</span>
been your fault. I must confide in some one, so I
have told you, and you may tell Jasper if you like.
Dear old Jasper! she will applaud me for my spirit.
Oh dear! do you know, Sylvia, I think you are
rather a tiresome girl. I thought you too would
have admired the plucky way I have acted.”
</p>
<p>
“How can I admire deceit and lies?” replied
Sylvia in a low tone.
</p>
<p>
“You dare say those words to me!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I dare. Oh, you have made me unhappy!
Oh, you have destroyed my day! Oh Eve, Eve, why
did you do it?”
</p>
<p>
“You won’t tell on me, please, Sylvia? You
have promised that, have you not?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, why should I tell? It is not my place. But
why did you do it?”
</p>
<p>
“If you will not tell, nothing matters. I have
done it, and it is not your affair.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, it is, now that you have confided in me.
Oh, you have made me unhappy!”
</p>
<p>
“You are a goose! But you may tell dear
Jasper; and tell her too that her little Eve will
wait for her at the turnstile on Tuesday night at
nine o’clock. Now then, let’s get ready or we
shall be late for dinner.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253'></a>253</span><a name='chXX' id='chXX'></a>CHAPTER XX.—“NOT GOOD NOR HONORABLE.”</h2>
<p>
It was very late indeed when Sylvia got home.
On this occasion she was not allowed to return to
The Priory unaccompanied; Lady Frances insisted
on Read going with her. Read said very little as
the two walked over the roads together; but she
was ever a woman of few words. Sylvia longed to
question her, as she wanted to take as much news as
possible to Jasper, but Read’s face was decidedly
uninviting. As soon as the woman had gone, Sylvia
slipped round to the back entrance, where Jasper
was waiting for her. Jasper had the gate ajar, and
Pilot was standing by her side.
</p>
<p>
“Come, darling—come right in,” she said. “The
coast is clear, and, oh! I have a lot to tell you.”
</p>
<p>
She fastened the back gate, making it look as
though it had not been disturbed for years, and a
moment later the woman and the girl were standing
in the warm kitchen.
</p>
<p>
“The door is locked, and he will not come,” said
Jasper. “He is quite well, and I heard him go up-stairs
to his bed an hour ago.”
</p>
<p>
“And did he eat anything, Jasper?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, did he not, my love? Oh, I am fit to die
with laughter when I think of it! He imagines
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254'></a>254</span>
that he has demolished one quarter of the scraggiest
hen in the hen-house.”
</p>
<p>
“What! old Wallaroo?” replied Sylvia, a smile
breaking over her face.
</p>
<p>
“Wallaroo, or whatever outlandish name you like
to call the bird.”
</p>
<p>
“Please tell me all about it.”
</p>
<p>
Sylvia sank down as she spoke into a chair.
Jasper related her morning’s adventure, and the two
laughed heartily.
</p>
<p>
“Only it seems a shame to deceive him,” said
Sylvia at last. “And so Wallaroo has really gone!
Do you know, I shall miss her; I have stood and
watched her antics for so many long days. She
was the most outrageous flirt of any bird I have
ever come across, and so indignant when old Roger
paid the least attention to any of his other wives.”
</p>
<p>
“She has passed her flirting days,” replied
Jasper, “and is now the property of little Tim Donovan
in the village; perhaps, however, she will get
more food there. My dear Miss Sylvia, you must
make up your mind that each one of those birds has
to be disposed of in secret, and that I in exchange
get in sleek and fat young fowls for your father’s
benefit. But now, that is enough on the subject for
the present. Tell me all about Miss Evelyn; I am
just dying to hear.”
</p>
<p>
“She will meet you on Tuesday evening at nine
o’clock by the turnstile in the shrubbery,” replied
Sylvia.
</p>
<p>
“That is right. What a brave, dear, plucky pet
she is!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255'></a>255</span>
</p>
<p>
Sylvia was silent.
</p>
<p>
“What is the matter with you, Miss Sylvia? Had
you not a happy day?”
</p>
<p>
“I had—very, very happy until just before
dinner.”
</p>
<p>
“And what happened then?”
</p>
<p>
“I will tell you in the morning, Jasper—not to-night.
Something happened then. I am sorry and
sad, but I will tell you in the morning. I must slip
up to bed now without father knowing it.”
</p>
<p>
“Your father thinks that you are in bed, for I went
up, just imitating your step to perfection, an hour
before he did, and I went into your room and shut
the door; and when he went up he knocked at the
door, and I answered in your voice that I had a bit
of a headache and had gone to bed. He asked me
if I had had any supper, and I said no; and he said
the best thing for a headache was to rest the stomach.
Bless you! he is keen on that, whatever else he is not
keen on. He went off to his bed thinking you were
snug in yours. When I made sure that he was
well in his bed, which I could tell by the creaking
of the bedstead, I let myself out. I had oiled the
lock previously. I shut the door without making
a sound loud enough to wake a mouse, and crept
down-stairs; and here I am. You must not go up
to-night or you will give me away, and there will
be a fine to-do. You must sleep in my cozy room
to-night.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I do not mind that,” replied Sylvia. “How
clever you are, Jasper! You really did manage most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256'></a>256</span>
wonderfully; only again I must say it seems a shame
to deceive my dear old father.”
</p>
<p>
“It is a question of dying in the cause of your dear
old father or deceiving him,” replied Jasper in blunt
tones. “Now then, come to bed, my love, for if you
are not dead with sleep I am.”
</p>
<p>
The next morning Mr. Leeson was in admirable
spirits. He met Sylvia at breakfast, and congratulated
her on the long day she had spent in the open
air.
</p>
<p>
“And you look all the better for it,” he said.
“I was too busy to think about you at tea-time;
indeed, I did not have any tea, having consumed a
most admirable luncheon some time before one
o’clock. I was so very busy attending to my accounts
all the afternoon that I quite forgot my dear little
girl. Well, I have made arrangements, dearest, to
buy shares in the Kilcolman Gold-mines. The thing
may or may not turn up trumps, but in any case I
have made an effort to spare a little money to buy
some of the shares. That means that we must be
extra prudent and careful for the next year or so.
You will aid me in that, will you not, Sylvia? You
will solemnly promise me, my dear and only child,
that you will not give way to recklessness; when you
see a penny you will look at it two or three times
before you spend it. You have not the least idea
how careful it makes you to keep what I call close
and accurate accounts, every farthing made to
produce its utmost value, and, if possible—if possible,
my dear Sylvia—saved. It is surprising how little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257'></a>257</span>
man really wants here below; the luxuries of the
present day are disgusting, enervating, unnecessary.
I speak to you very seriously, for now and then, I
grieve to say, I have seen traces in you of what
rendered my married life unhappy.”
</p>
<p>
“Father, you must not speak against mother,”
said Sylvia. Her face was pale and her voice
trembled. “There was no one like mother,” she
continued, “and for her sake I——”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Sylvia, what do you do for her sake?”
</p>
<p>
“I put up with this death in life. Oh father,
father, do you think I really—really like it?”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Leeson looked with some alarm at his child.
Sylvia’s eyes were full of tears; she laid her hands
on the table, bent forward, and looked full across at
her father.
</p>
<p>
“For mother’s sake I bear it; you cannot think
that I like it!” she repeated.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Leeson’s first amazement now gave place to
cold displeasure.
</p>
<p>
“We will not pursue this topic,” he said. “I have
something more to tell you. I made a pleasant discovery
yesterday. During your absence a strange
thing occurred. A gipsy woman entered the avenue
and walked up to the front door, unmolested by
Pilot. She seemed to have a strange power over
Pilot, for the dog did not bar her entrance in the
least. I naturally went to see what she wanted, and
she told me that she had come, thinking I might
have some fowls for sale. Now, you know, my
dear, those old birds in the hen-house have long been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258'></a>258</span>
eating their heads off, and I rather hailed an opportunity
of getting rid of them; they only lay eggs—and
that but a few—in the warm weather, and
during the winter we are at a loss by our efforts to
keep them alive.”
</p>
<p>
“I know plenty about fowls,” said Sylvia then.
“They need hot suppers and all sorts of good things
to make them lay eggs in cold weather.”
</p>
<p>
“We can do without eggs, but we cannot afford
to give the fowls hot suppers,” said Mr. Leeson in
a tone of great dignity. “But now, Sylvia, to the
point. The woman offered a ludicrous price for the
birds, and of course I would not part with them;
at the same time she incidentally—silly person—gave
herself away. She let me understand that she
wanted the fowls to stew down in the gipsy pot.
Now, of late, when arranging my recipes for publication,
I have often thought of the gipsies and the
delicious stews they make out of all sorts of things
which other people would throw away. It occurred
to me, therefore, to question her; and the result was,
dear, not to go too much into particulars, that she
killed one of the fowls, and in a very short time
brought me a delicious stew made out of the bird,
really as tasty and succulent as anything I have ever
swallowed. I paid her a trifle for her services, and
the remainder of the fowl is at the present moment
lying in the cupboard in our sitting-room. I should
like it to be warmed up for our midday repast; there
is a great deal more there than we can by any possibility
consume, but we can have a dainty meal out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259'></a>259</span>
of part of the stew, and the rest can be saved for
supper. I have further decided that we must get
some one to kill the rest of the birds, and we will
have them one by one on the table. Do you ever,
my dear Sylvia, in your perambulations abroad, go
near any of the gipsies?—for, if so, I should not
mind giving you a shilling to purchase that woman’s
recipe.”
</p>
<p>
Sylvia at this juncture rose from the table. She
had with the utmost difficulty kept her composure
while her father was so innocently talking about the
gipsy’s stew.
</p>
<p>
“I will see—I will see, father. I quite understand,”
she said; and the next instant she ran out
of the room.
</p>
<p>
“Really,” thought Mr. Leeson when she had gone,
“Sylvia talks a little strangely at times. Just think
how she spoke just now of her happy home! Death
in life, she called it—a most wrong and exaggerated
term; and exaggeration of speech leads to extravagance
of mind, and extravagance of mind means most
reckless expenditure. If I am not very careful my
poor child will soon be on the road to ruin. I doubt
if I ought to feed her up with dainties—and really
that stewed fowl made a rare and delicious dish—but
it is the most saving thing I can do; there are
enough birds in the hen-house to last Sylvia and me
for several weeks to come.”
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Sylvia had rushed off to Jasper.
</p>
<p>
“Oh Jasper!” she said, “I nearly died with
laughter, and yet it is horrid to deceive him. Oh!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260'></a>260</span>
please do not kill any more of the birds for a long
time; it is more than I can stand. Father is so delighted;
and he has offered me a shilling to buy the
recipe from you.”
</p>
<p>
“Bless you, dear!” replied Jasper, “and I think
what I am doing for your father is well worth a
shilling, so you had better give it to me.”
</p>
<p>
“I have not got it yet,” replied Sylvia. “You
must live on trust, Jasper; but, oh, it is quite too
funny!”
</p>
<p>
“Now, you sit down just there,” said Jasper, “and
tell me what troubled you last night.”
</p>
<p>
Sylvia’s face changed utterly when Jasper spoke.
</p>
<p>
“It is about Eve,” she said. “She has done very
wrong—very wrong indeed.” And then Sylvia related
exactly what had occurred at school.
</p>
<p>
Jasper stood and listened with her arms akimbo;
her face more than once underwent a curious expression.
</p>
<p>
“And so you blame my little Eve very much?”
she said when Sylvia had ceased speaking.
</p>
<p>
“How can I help it? To get the whole school accused—to
tell a lie to do it! Oh Jasper, how can
I help myself?”
</p>
<p>
“You were brought up so differently,” said Jasper.
“Maybe if I had had the rearing of you and the
loving of you from your earliest days I might have
thought with you; as it is, I think with Eve. I
could not counsel her to tell. I cannot but admire
her spirit when she did what she did.”
</p>
<p>
“Jasper! Jasper!” said Sylvia in a tone of horror,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261'></a>261</span>
“you cannot—cannot mean what you are saying!
Oh, please unsay those dreadful words! I was
hoping—hoping—hoping that you might put things
right. What is to be done? There is going to be
a great fuss—a great commotion—a great trouble at
Miss Henderson’s school. Evelyn can put it right
by confessing; are you not going to urge her to
confess?”
</p>
<p>
“I urge my darling to lower herself! Miss Sylvia,
if you say that kind of thing to me again, you and
I can scarcely be friends.”
</p>
<p>
“Jasper! Jasper!”
</p>
<p>
“We won’t talk about it,” said Jasper, with decision.
“I love you, miss, and what is more, I
respect and admire you, but I cannot rise as high
as you, Miss Sylvia; I was not reared so. I do not
think that my little Eve could have done other than
she did when she was so tempted.”
</p>
<p>
“Then, Jasper, you are a bad friend to Evelyn—a
very bad friend; and what is more, if there is great
trouble at the school, and if Audrey gets into it, and
if Evelyn herself will never tell, why, I must.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, good gracious! you would not be so mean
as that; and the poor, dear little innocent confided
in you!”
</p>
<p>
“I do not want to be so mean, and I will not tell
for a long, long time; but I will tell—I will—if no one
else can put it right, for it is quite too cruel.”
</p>
<p>
Jasper looked long and full at Sylvia.
</p>
<p>
“This may mean a good deal,” she said—“more
than you think. And have you no sense of honor,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262'></a>262</span>
miss? What you are told in confidence, have you
any right to give to the world?”
</p>
<p>
“I will not tell if I can help myself, but this
matter has made me very unhappy indeed.”
</p>
<p>
Then Sylvia put on her shabby hat and went out.
She passed the fowl-house, and stood for a moment,
a sad smile on her face, looking down at the ill-fed
birds. Then she went along the tiny shrubbery to
the front entrance, and, accompanied as usual by her
beloved Pilot, started forth. She was in her very
shabbiest and oldest dress to-day, and the joy and
brightness of her appearance of twenty-four hours
ago had absolutely left her young face. It was Sunday
morning, but Sylvia never went to church. She
heard the bells ringing now. Sweetly they pealed
across the valley, and one little church on the top
of the hill sent forth a low and yet joyful chime.
Sylvia longed to press her hands to her ears; she did
not want to listen to the church bells. Those who
went to church did right, not wrong; those who
went to church listened to God’s Word, and followed
the ways—the good and holy ways—of religion.
</p>
<p>
“And I cannot go because of my shabby, shabby
dress,” she thought. “But why should I not wear
the beautiful dress I had yesterday and venture to
church?”
</p>
<p>
No sooner had the thought come to her than she
returned, dashed in by the back entrance, desired
Pilot to stay where he was, flew up-stairs, dressed
herself recklessly in her rich finery of yesterday, and
started off for church. She had a fancy to go to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263'></a>263</span>
church on the top of the hill, but she had to walk
fast to reach it. She did arrive there a little late.
The verger showed her into a pew half-way up the
church. One or two people turned to stare at the
handsome girl. The brilliant color was in her
cheeks from the quickness of her walk. She dropped
on her knees and covered her face; all was confusion
in her mind. In the Squire’s pew, a very short distance
away, sat Audrey and Evelyn. Could Evelyn
indeed mean to pray? Of what sort of nature was
Evelyn made? Sylvia felt that she could not meet
her eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Some people who are not good, who are not honorable,
go to church,” she thought to herself. “It
is very sad and very puzzling.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264'></a>264</span><a name='chXXI' id='chXXI'></a>CHAPTER XXI.—THE TORN BOOK.</h2>
<p>
On the following morning Audrey and Evelyn
started off for school. On the way Audrey turned
to her companion.
</p>
<p>
“I wonder if anything has been discovered with
regard to the injured book?” she said.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I wish you would not talk so continually
about that stupid old fuss!” said Evelyn in her crossest
voice.
</p>
<p>
“It is useless to shirk it,” was Audrey’s reply.
“You do not suppose for a single moment that Miss
Henderson will not get to the bottom of the mischief?
For my part, I think I could understand a girl doing
it just for a moment in a spirit of revenge, although
I have never yet felt revengeful to any one—but
how any one could keep it up and allow the school
to get into trouble is what puzzles me.”
</p>
<p>
“Were you ever at school before, Audrey?” was
Evelyn’s remark.
</p>
<p>
“No; were you?”
</p>
<p>
“I wish I had been; I have always longed for
school.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, you have your wish at last. How do you
like it?”
</p>
<p>
“I should like it fairly well if I were put into a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265'></a>265</span>
higher form, and if this stupid fuss were not going
on.”
</p>
<p>
“Why do you dislike the subject being mentioned
so much?”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn colored slightly. Audrey looked at her.
There was no suspicion in Audrey’s eyes; it was
absolutely impossible for her to connect her cousin
with anything so mean and low. Evelyn had a
great many objectionable habits, but that she could
commit what was in Audrey’s opinion a very grave
sin, and then tell lies about it, was more than the
young girl could either imagine or realize.
</p>
<p>
The pretty governess-cart took them to school in
good time, and the usual routine of the morning
began. It was immediately after prayers, however,
that Miss Henderson spoke from her desk to the assembled
school.
</p>
<p>
“I am sorry to tell you all,” she began, “that up
to the present I have not got the slightest clue to the
mystery of the injured book. I have questioned, I
have gone carefully into every particular, and all I
can find out is that the book was left in classroom
No. 4 (which is usually occupied by the girls of the
Fourth Form); that it was placed there at nine
o’clock in the morning, and was not used again by
Miss Thompson until school was over—namely,
between five and six o’clock in the evening. During
that time, as far as I can make out, only one girl was
alone in the room. That girl was Evelyn Wynford.
I do not in any way accuse Evelyn Wynford of
having committed the sin—for sin it was—but I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266'></a>266</span>
have to mention the fact that she was alone in the
room during recess, having failed to learn a lesson
which had been set her. During the afternoon the
room was, as far as I can tell, empty for a couple of
hours, and of course some one may have come in
then and done the mischief. I therefore have not
the slightest intention of suspecting a girl who only
arrived that morning; but I mention the fact, all the
same, that Evelyn Wynford was <em>alone in the room
for the space of twenty minutes</em>.”
</p>
<p>
While Miss Henderson was speaking all eyes were
turned in Evelyn’s direction; all eyes saw a white
and stubborn face, and two angry brown eyes that
flashed almost wildly round the room and then
looked down. Just for an instant a few of the girls
said to themselves, “That is a guilty face.” But
again they thought, “How could she do it? Why
should she do it? No, it certainly cannot be Evelyn
Wynford.”
</p>
<p>
As to Audrey, she pitied Evelyn very much. She
thought it extremely hard on her that Miss Henderson
should have singled her out for individual notice
on this most painful occasion, and out of pity for her
she would not once glance in her direction.
</p>
<p>
Miss Henderson paused for a moment; then she
continued:
</p>
<p>
“Whoever the sinner may be, I am determined to
sift this crime to the bottom. I shall severely punish
the girl who tore the book unless she makes up
her mind to confess to me between now and to-morrow
evening. If she confesses before school is over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267'></a>267</span>
to-morrow evening, I shall not only not punish but I
shall forgive her. It will be my painful duty, however,
to oblige her to confess her sin before the entire
school, as in no other way can the rest of the
girls be exonerated. I give her till to-morrow evening
to make up her mind. I hope she will ask for
strength from above to enable her to make this very
painful confession. I myself shall pray that she may
be guided aright. If no one comes forward by that
time, I must again assemble the school to suggest a
very terrible alternative.”
</p>
<p>
Here Miss Henderson left the room, and the different
members of the school went off to their respective
duties.
</p>
<p>
School went on much as usual. The girls were
forced to attend to their numerous duties; the all-absorbing
theme was therefore held more or less in
abeyance for the time being. At recess, however,
knots of girls might be seen talking to one another
in agitated whispers. The subject of the injured
book was the one topic on every one’s tongue.
Evelyn produced chocolates, crystallized fruits, and
other dainties from a richly embroidered bag which
she wore at her side, and soon had her own little
coterie of followers. To these she imparted her
opinion that Miss Henderson was not only a fuss, but
a dragon; that probably a servant had torn the book—or
perhaps, she added, Miss Thompson herself.
</p>
<p>
“Why,” said Evelyn, “should not Miss Thompson
greatly dislike Miss Henderson, and tear the outside
page out of the book just to spite her?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268'></a>268</span>
</p>
<p>
But this theory was not received as possible by
any one to whom she imparted it. Miss Thompson
was a favorite; Miss Thompson hated no one;
Miss Thompson was the last person on earth to do
such a shabby thing.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Evelyn crossly, “I don’t know who
did it; and what is more, I don’t care. Come and
walk with me, Alice,” she said to a pretty little curly-headed
girl who sat next to her at class. “Come
and let me tell you about all the grandeur which will
be mine by and by. I shall be queen by and by.
It is a shame—a downright shame—to worry a girl
in my position with such a trifle as a torn book.
The best thing we can all do is to subscribe amongst
ourselves and give the old dragon another <em>Sesame and
Lilies</em>. I don’t mind subscribing. Is it not a good
thought?”
</p>
<p>
“But that will not help her,” said Alice; while
Cherry, who stood near, solemnly shook her head.
</p>
<p>
“Why will it not help her?” asked Evelyn.
</p>
<p>
“Because it was the inscription she valued—the
inscription in her brother’s writing; her brother who
is dead, you know.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn was about to make another pert remark
when a memory assailed her. Naughty, heartless,
rude as she was, she had somewhere a spark of feeling.
If she had loved any one it was the excitable
and strange woman she had called “mothery.”
</p>
<p>
“If mothery gave me something and wrote my
name in it I’d be fond of it,” she thought; and just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269'></a>269</span>
for a moment a prick of remorse visited her hard
little heart.
</p>
<p>
No other girl in the whole school could confess the
crime which Evelyn had committed, and the evening
came in considerable gloom and excitement. Audrey
could talk of nothing else on their way home.
</p>
<p>
“It is terrible,” said Audrey. “I am really sorry
we are both at the school; it makes things so unpleasant
for us. And you, Evelyn—I did pity you when
Miss Henderson said to-day that you were alone in
the room. Did you not feel awful?”
</p>
<p>
“No, I did not,” replied Evelyn. “At least, perhaps
I did just for a minute.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, it was very brave of you. I should not
have liked to be in your position.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn turned the conversation.
</p>
<p>
“I wonder whether any one will confess to-morrow,”
said Audrey again.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps it was one of the servants,” remarked
Evelyn. Then she said abruptly, “Oh, do let us
change the subject!”
</p>
<p>
“There is something fine about Evelyn after all,”
thought Audrey; “And I am so glad! She took
that speech of Miss Henderson’s very well indeed.
Now, I scarcely thought it fair to have her name
singled out in the way it was. Surely Miss Henderson
could not have suspected my little cousin!”
</p>
<p>
At dinner Audrey mentioned the whole circumstance
of the torn book to her parents. The girls
were again dining with the Squire and Lady Frances.
The Squire was interested for a short time; he then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270'></a>270</span>
began to chat with Evelyn, who was fast, in her
curious fashion, becoming a favorite of his. She was
always at her best in his society, and now nestled up
close to him, and said in an almost winsome manner:
</p>
<p>
“Don’t let us talk about the old fuss at school.”
</p>
<p>
“Whom do you call the old fuss, Evelyn?”
</p>
<p>
“Miss Henderson. I don’t like her a bit, Uncle
Edward.”
</p>
<p>
“That is very naughty, Evelyn. Remember, I
want you to like her.”
</p>
<p>
“Why?”
</p>
<p>
“Because for the present, at least, she is your
instructress.”
</p>
<p>
“But why should I like my instructress?”
</p>
<p>
“She cannot influence you unless you like her.”
</p>
<p>
“Then she will never influence me, because I
shall never like her,” cried the reckless girl. “I
wish you would teach me, Uncle Edward. I should
learn from you; you would influence me because I
love you.”
</p>
<p>
“I do try to influence you, Evelyn, and I want
you to do a great many things for me.”
</p>
<p>
“I would do anything in all the world for him,”
thought Evelyn, “except confess that I tore that
book; but that I would not do even for him. Of
course, now that there has been such an awful fuss,
I am sorry I did it, but for no other reason. It is
one comfort, however, they cannot possibly suspect
me.”
</p>
<p>
Lady Frances, however, took Audrey’s information
in a very different spirit from what her husband
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271'></a>271</span>
did. She felt indignant at Evelyn’s having been
singled out for special and undoubtedly unfavorable
notice by Miss Henderson, and resolved to call at
the school the next day to have an interview with
the head-mistress. She said nothing to Audrey about
her intention, and the girls went off to school without
the least idea of what Lady Frances was about
to do. Her carriage stopped before Chepstow
House a little before noon. She inquired for Miss
Henderson, and was immediately admitted into the
head-mistress’s private sitting-room. There Miss
Henderson a moment or two later joined her.
</p>
<p>
“I am sorry to trouble you,” began Lady Frances
at once, “but I have come on a matter which occasioned
me a little distress. I allude to the mystery
of the torn book. Audrey has told me all about it,
so I am in possession of full particulars. Of course
I am extremely sorry for you, and can quite understand
your feelings with regard to the injury of a
book you value so much; but, at the same time,
you will excuse my saying, Miss Henderson, that I
think your mentioning Evelyn’s name in the way
you did was a little too obvious. It was uncomfortable
for the poor child, although I understand from
my daughter that she took it extremely well.”
</p>
<p>
“In a case of this kind,” replied Miss Henderson
quietly, “one has to be just, and not to allow any
favoritism to appear.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, certainly,” said Lady Frances; “it was my
wish in sending both girls to school that they should
find their level.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272'></a>272</span>
</p>
<p>
“And I regret to say,” answered Miss Henderson,
“that your niece’s level is not a high one.”
</p>
<p>
“Alas! I am aware of it. I have been terribly
pained since Evelyn came home by her recklessness
and want of obedience; but this is a very different
matter. This shows a most depraved nature; and
of course you cannot for a moment have suspected
my niece when you spoke of her being alone in the
room.”
</p>
<p>
“Had any other girl been alone in the room I
should equally have mentioned her name,” said
Miss Henderson. “I certainly did not at the time
suspect Miss Wynford.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean by ‘did not at the time’?
Have you changed your opinion?”
</p>
<p>
Lady Frances’s face turned very white.
</p>
<p>
“I am sorry to say that I have.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?”
</p>
<p>
“If you will pardon me for a moment I will explain.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Henderson left the room.
</p>
<p>
While she was absent Lady Frances felt a cold
dew breaking out on her forehead.
</p>
<p>
“This is beyond everything,” she thought. “But
it is impossible; the child could never have done it.
What motive would she have? She is not as bad
as that; and it was her very first day at school.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Henderson re-entered the room, accompanied
by Miss Thompson. In Miss Thompson’s hand was
a copy of the History of England that Evelyn had
been using.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273'></a>273</span>
</p>
<p>
“Will you kindly open that book,” said Miss
Henderson, “and show Lady Frances what you have
found there?”
</p>
<p>
Miss Thompson did so. She opened the History
at the reign of Edward I. Between the leaves were
to be seen two fragments of torn paper. Miss
Thompson removed them carefully and laid them
upon Lady Frances’s hand. Lady Frances glanced
at them, and saw that they were beyond doubt torn
from a copy of Ruskin’s <em>Sesame and Lilies</em>. She let
them drop back again on to the open page of the
book.
</p>
<p>
“I accuse no one,” said Miss Henderson. “Even
now I accuse no one; but I grieve to tell you, Lady
Frances, that this book was in the hands of your
niece, Evelyn Wynford, on that afternoon.—Miss
Thompson, will you relate the entire circumstances
to Lady Frances?”
</p>
<p>
“I am very, very sorry,” said Miss Thompson.
“I wish with all my heart I had understood the
child better, but of course she was a stranger to me.
The circumstance was this: I gave her the history
of the reign of Edward I. to look over during class,
as of course on her first day at school she had no
regular lessons ready. She glanced at it, told me
she knew the reign, and amused herself looking
about during the remainder of the time. At recess
I called her to me and questioned her. She seemed
to be totally ignorant of anything relating to
Edward I. I reproved her for having made an incorrect
statement——”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274'></a>274</span>
</p>
<p>
“For having told a lie, you mean,” snapped Lady
Frances.
</p>
<p>
Miss Thompson bowed.
</p>
<p>
“I reproved her, and as a punishment desired her
to look over the reign while the other girls were in
the playground.”
</p>
<p>
“And quite right,” said Lady Frances.
</p>
<p>
“She was very much annoyed, but I was firm.
I left her with the book in her hand. I have nothing
more to say. At six o’clock that evening I
removed <em>Sesame and Lilies</em> from its place in the
classroom, and took it away to continue the preparation
of a lecture. I then found that several
pages had been removed. This morning, early, I
happened to take this very copy of the History, and
found these fragments in the part of the book which
contains the reign of Edward I.”
</p>
<p>
“Suspicion undoubtedly now points to Evelyn,”
said Miss Henderson; “and I must say, Lady
Frances, that although a matter of this kind pertains
entirely to the school, and must be dealt with
absolutely by the head-mistress, yet your having
called, and in a measure taken the matter up, relieves
me of a certain responsibility.”
</p>
<p>
“Suspicion does undoubtedly point to the unhappy
child,” said Lady Frances; “but still, I can scarcely
believe it. What do you mean to do?”
</p>
<p>
“I shall to-morrow morning have to state before
the entire school what I have now stated to you.”
</p>
<p>
“It might be best for me to remove Evelyn, and
let her confess to you in writing.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275'></a>275</span>
</p>
<p>
“I do not think that would be either right or fair.
If the girl is taken away now she is practically injured
for life. Give her a chance, I beseech you,
Lady Frances, of retrieving her character.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, what is to be done?” said Lady Frances.
“To think that my daughter should have a girl like
that for a companion! You do not know how we
are all to be pitied.”
</p>
<p>
“I do indeed; you have my sincere sympathy,”
said Miss Henderson.
</p>
<p>
“And what do you advise?”
</p>
<p>
“I think, as she is a member of the school, you
must leave her to me. She committed this offense
on the very first day of her school-life, and if possible
we must not be too severe on her. She has not
been brought up as an English girl.”
</p>
<p>
Lady Frances talked a little longer with the head-mistress,
and went away; she felt terribly miserable
and unhappy.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276'></a>276</span><a name='chXXII' id='chXXII'></a>CHAPTER XXII.—“STICK TO YOUR COLORS, EVELYN.”</h2>
<p>
Evelyn met Jasper, as arranged, on Tuesday
evening. She found it quite easy to slip away unnoticed,
for in truth Lady Frances was too unhappy
to watch her movements particularly. The girls had
been dining alone. Audrey had a headache, and had
gone to bed early. Evelyn rushed up to her room,
put on a dark shawl, which completely covered her
fair hair and white-robed little figure, and rushed
out by a side entrance. She wore thin shoes, however,
being utterly reckless with regard to her
health. Jasper was waiting for her. It took but an
instant for Jasper to clasp her in her arms, lifting
her off the ground as she did so.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my little darling,” cried the affectionate
woman—“my sweet little white Eve! Oh, let me
hug you; let me kiss you! Oh, my pet! it is like
cold water to a thirsty person to clasp you in my
arms again.”
</p>
<p>
“Do not squeeze me quite so tight, Jasper,” said
Evelyn. “Yes, of course, I am glad to see you—very
glad.”
</p>
<p>
“But let me feel your feet, pet. Oh, to think of
your running out like this in your house-shoes!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277'></a>277</span>
You will catch your death! Here, I will sit down
on this step and keep you in my arms. Now, is not
that cozy, my fur cloak wrapped round you, feet and
all? Is not that nice, little Eve?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, very nice,” said Evelyn. “It is almost as
good as if I were back again on the ranch with
mothery and you.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah, the happy old days!” sighed Jasper.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, they were very happy, Jasper. I almost
wish I was back again. I am worried a good bit;
things are not what I thought they would be in England.
There is no fuss made about me, and at school
they treat me so horribly.”
</p>
<p>
“You bide your time, my love; you bide your
time.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t like school, Jas.”
</p>
<p>
“And why not, my beauty? You know you must
be taught, my dear Miss Evelyn; an ignorant young
lady has no chance at all in these enlightened days.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! please, Jas, do not talk so much like a
horrid book; be your true old self. What does
learning matter?”
</p>
<p>
“Everything, love; I assure you it does.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I shall never be learned; it is too much
trouble.”
</p>
<p>
“But why don’t you like school, pet?”
</p>
<p>
“I will tell you. I have got into a scrape; I did
not mean to, but I have.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you mean about that book. Sylvia told me.
Why did you tell Sylvia, Evelyn?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278'></a>278</span>
</p>
<p>
“I had to tell some one, and she is not a schoolgirl.”
</p>
<p>
“She is not your sort, Evelyn.”
</p>
<p>
“Is she not? I like her very much.”
</p>
<p>
“But she is not your sort; for instance, she could
not do a thing of that kind.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I do not suppose many people would have
spirit enough,” said Evelyn in the voice of one who
had done a very fine act.
</p>
<p>
“She could not do it,” repeated Jasper; “and I
expect she is in the right, and that you, my little
love, are in the wrong. You were differently
trained. Well, my dear Eve, the long and short of
it is that I admire what you did, only somehow
Sylvia does not, and you will have to be very careful
or she may——”
</p>
<p>
“What—what, Jasper?”
</p>
<p>
“She may not regard it as a secret that she will
always keep.”
</p>
<p>
“Is she that sort? Oh, the horrid, horrid thing!”
said Evelyn. “Oh, to think that I should have told
her! But you cannot mean it; it is impossible that
you can mean it, Jasper!”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you fret, love, for I will not let her. If
she dares to tell on you, why, I will leave her, and then
it is pretty near starvation for the poor little miss.”
</p>
<p>
“You are sure you will not let her tell? I really
am in rather a nasty scrape. They are making such
a horrid fuss at school. This evening was the limit
given for the guilty person—I should not say the
guilty person, but the spirited person—to tell, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279'></a>279</span>
the spirited person has not told; and to-morrow
morning goodness knows what will happen. Miss
Henderson has a rod in pickle for us all, I expect.
I declare it is quite exciting. None of the girls suspect
me, and I talk so openly, and sometimes they
laugh, too. I suppose we shall all be punished. I
do not really know what is going to be done.”
</p>
<p>
“You hold your tongue and let the whole matter
slide. That is my advice,” said Jasper. “I would
either do that or I would out with it boldly—one or
the other. Say you did it, and that you are not
ashamed to have done it.”
</p>
<p>
“I could not—I could not,” said Evelyn. “I may
be brave after a fashion, but I am not brave enough
for that. Besides, you know, Jasper, I did say
already that I had not done it.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, to be sure,” answered Jasper. “I forgot
that. Well, you must stick to your colors now, Eve;
and at the worst, my darling, you have but to come
to me and I will shield you.”
</p>
<p>
“At the worst—yes, at the worst,” said Evelyn.
“I will remember that. But if I want to come to
you very badly how can I?”
</p>
<p>
“I will come every night to this stile at nine
o’clock, and if you want me you will find me. I
will stay here for exactly five minutes, and any message
you may like to give you can put under this
stone. Now, is not that a ’cute thought of your
dear old Jasper’s?”
</p>
<p>
“It is—it is,” said the little girl. “Perhaps,
Jasper, I had better be going back now.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280'></a>280</span>
</p>
<p>
“In a minute, darling—in a minute.”
</p>
<p>
“And how are you getting on with Sylvia,
Jasper?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, such fun, dear! I am having quite an exciting
time—hidden from the old gentleman, and
acting the gipsy, and pretending I am feeding him
with old fowls when I am giving him the tenderest
chicken. You have not, darling, a little scrap of
money to spare that you can help old Jasper with?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! you are so greedy, Jasper; you are always
asking for things. Uncle Edward makes me an
allowance, but not much; no one would suppose I
was the heiress of everything.”
</p>
<p>
“Well dear, the money don’t matter. I will come
here again to-morrow night. Now, keep up your
pecker, little Eve, and all will be well.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn kissed Jasper, and was about to run back
to the house when the good woman remembered the
light shoes in which she had come out.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll carry you back,” she said. “Those precious
little feet shall not touch the frosty ground.”
</p>
<p>
Jasper was very strong, and Evelyn was all too
willing. She was carried to within fifty yards of the
side entrance in Jasper’s strong arms; then she
dashed back to the house, kissed her hand to the
dark shadow under a tree, and returned to her own
room. Read had seen her, but Evelyn knew nothing
of that. Read had had her suspicions before now,
and determined, as she said, to keep a sharp lookout
on young miss in future.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281'></a>281</span><a name='chXXIII' id='chXXIII'></a>CHAPTER XXIII.—ONE WEEK OF GRACE.</h2>
<p>
There never was a woman more distressed and
puzzled than Miss Henderson. She consulted with
her sister, Miss Lucy; she consulted with her favorite
teacher, Miss Thompson. They talked into
the small hours of the night, and finally it was resolved
that Evelyn should have another chance.
</p>
<p>
“I must appeal to her honor; it is impossible that
any girl could be quite destitute of that quality,”
said Miss Henderson.
</p>
<p>
“I am sure you are doing right, sister,” said Miss
Lucy. “Once you harden a girl you do for her.
Whatever Evelyn Wynford’s faults may be, she will
hold a high position one day. It would be terrible—more
than terrible—if she grew up a wicked
woman. How awful to have power and not to use
it aright! My dear Maria, whatever you are, be
merciful.”
</p>
<p>
“I must pray to God to guide me aright,” answered
Miss Maria. “This is a case for a right judgment
in all things. Poor child! I pity her from my
heart; but how to bring her to the necessary confession
is the question.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Henderson went to bed, but not to sleep.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282'></a>282</span>
Early in the morning she arose, having made up her
mind what to do.
</p>
<p>
Accordingly, when Audrey and Evelyn arrived in
the pretty little governess-cart—Audrey with a high
color in her cheeks, looking as sweet and fresh and
good and nice as English girl could look, and Evelyn
tripping after her with a certain defiance on her
white face and a look of hostility in her brown eyes—they
were both greeted by Miss Henderson herself.
</p>
<p>
“Ah, Audrey dear,” she said in a cheerful and
friendly tone, “how are you this morning?—How do
you do, Evelyn?—No, Audrey, you are not late;
you are quite in nice time. Will you go to the
schoolroom, my dear? I will join you presently
for prayers.—Evelyn, can I have a word with you?”
</p>
<p>
“Why so?” asked Evelyn, backing a little.
</p>
<p>
“Because I have something I want to say to you.”
</p>
<p>
Audrey also stood still. She cast a hostile glance
at Miss Henderson, saying to herself:
</p>
<p>
“After all, my head-mistress is horribly unfair;
she is doubtless going to tell Evelyn that she suspects
her.”
</p>
<p>
“Evelyn,” said Audrey, “I will wait for you in the
dressing-room if Miss Henderson has no objection.”
</p>
<p>
“But I have, for it may be necessary for me to
detain your cousin for a short time,” said Miss
Henderson. “Go, Audrey; do not keep me any
longer.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn stood sullenly and perfectly still in the
hall; Audrey disappeared in the direction of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283'></a>283</span>
schoolrooms. Miss Henderson now took Evelyn’s
hand and led her into her private sitting-room.
</p>
<p>
“What do you want me for?” asked the little
girl.
</p>
<p>
“I want to say something to you, Evelyn.”
</p>
<p>
“Then say it, please.”
</p>
<p>
“You must not be pert.”
</p>
<p>
“I do not know what ‘pert’ is.”
</p>
<p>
“What you are now. But there, my dear child,
please control yourself; believe me, I am truly sorry
for you.”
</p>
<p>
“Then you need not be,” said Evelyn, with a toss
of her head. “I do not want anybody to be sorry
for me. I am one of the most lucky girls in the
world. Sorry for me! Please don’t. Mothery
could never bear to be pitied, and I won’t be pitied;
I have nothing to be pitied for.”
</p>
<p>
“Who did you say never cared to be pitied?”
asked Miss Henderson.
</p>
<p>
“Never you mind.”
</p>
<p>
“And yet, Evelyn, I think I have heard the words.
You allude to your mother. I understand from Lady
Frances that your mother is dead. You loved her,
did you not?”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn gave a quick nod; her face seemed to say,
“That is nothing to you.”
</p>
<p>
“I see you did, and she was fond of you.”
</p>
<p>
In spite of herself Evelyn gave another nod.
</p>
<p>
“Poor little girl; how sad to be without her!”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t,” said Evelyn in a strained voice.
</p>
<p>
“You lived all your early days in Tasmania, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284'></a>284</span>
your mother was good to you because she loved you,
and you loved her back; you tried to please her
because you loved her.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, bother!” said Evelyn.
</p>
<p>
“Come here, dear.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn did not budge an inch.
</p>
<p>
“Come over to me,” said Miss Henderson.
</p>
<p>
Miss Henderson was not accustomed to being disobeyed.
Her tone was not loud, but it was quiet
and determined. She looked full at Evelyn. Her
eyes were kind. Evelyn felt as if they mesmerized
her. Step by step, very unwillingly, she approached
the side of the head-mistress.
</p>
<p>
“I love girls like you,” said Miss Henderson then.
</p>
<p>
“Bother!” said Evelyn again.
</p>
<p>
“And I do not mind even when they are sulky
and rude and naughty, as you are now; still, I love
them—I love them because I am sorry for them.”
</p>
<p>
“You need not be sorry for me; I won’t have you
sorry for me,” said Evelyn.
</p>
<p>
“If I must not be sorry for you I must be something
else.”
</p>
<p>
“What?”
</p>
<p>
“Angry with you.”
</p>
<p>
“Why so? I never! What do you mean now?”
</p>
<p>
“I must be angry with you, Evelyn—very angry.
But I will say no more by way of excusing my own
conduct. I will say nothing of either sorrow or
anger. I want to state a fact to you.”
</p>
<p>
“Get it over,” said Evelyn.
</p>
<p>
Miss Henderson now approached the table; she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285'></a>285</span>
opened the History at the reign of Edward I.,
and taking two tiny fragments of torn paper from
the pages of the book, she laid them in her open
palm. In her other hand she held the mutilated
copy of <em>Sesame and Lilies</em>. The print on the torn
scrap exactly corresponded with the print in the injured
volume. Miss Henderson glanced from Evelyn
to the scraps of paper, and from Evelyn to the copy
of Ruskin.
</p>
<p>
“You have intelligence,” she said; “you must see
what this means.”
</p>
<p>
She then carefully replaced the bits of paper in
the History and laid it on the table by her side.
</p>
<p>
“Between now,” she said, “and this time yesterday
Miss Thompson discovered these scraps of paper
in the copy of the History which you had to read
on the morning of the day when you first came to
school. The scraps are evidently part of the pages
torn from the injured book. Have you anything
to say with regard to them?”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn shook her head; her face was white and her
eyes bright. But there was a small red spot on each
cheek—a spot about the size of a farthing. It did
not grow any larger. It gave a curious effect to the
pallid face. The obstinacy of the mouth was very
apparent. The cleft in the chin still further showed
the curious bias of the girl’s character.
</p>
<p>
“Have you anything to say—any remark to
make?”
</p>
<p>
Again the head was slowly shaken.
</p>
<p>
“Is there any reason why I should not immediately after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286'></a>286</span>
prayers to-day explain these circumstances
to the whole school, and allow the school to draw its
own conclusions?”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn now raised her eyes and fixed them on
Miss Henderson’s face.
</p>
<p>
“You will not do that, will you?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
“Have you ever, Evelyn, heard of such a thing as
circumstantial evidence?”
</p>
<p>
“No. What is it?”
</p>
<p>
“You are very ignorant, my dear child—ignorant
as well as wilful; wilful as well as wicked.”
</p>
<p>
“No, I am not wicked; you shall not say it!”
</p>
<p>
“Tell me, is there any reason why I should not
show what I have now shown you to the rest of
the school, and allow the school to draw its own
conclusion?”
</p>
<p>
“You won’t—will you?”
</p>
<p>
“Must I explain to you, Evelyn, what this means?”
</p>
<p>
“You can say anything you like.”
</p>
<p>
“These scraps of paper prove beyond doubt that
you, for some extraordinary reason, were the person
who tore the book. Why you did it is beyond my
conception, is beyond Miss Thompson’s conception,
is beyond the conception of my sister Lucy; but that
you did do it we none of us for a moment doubt.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you are wicked! How dare you think such
things of me?”
</p>
<p>
“Tell me, Evelyn—tell me why you did it. Come
here and tell me. I will not be unkind to you, my
poor little girl. I am sorry for one so ignorant, so
wanting in all conceptions of right or wrong. Tell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287'></a>287</span>
me, dear, and as there is a God in heaven, Evelyn, I
will forgive you.”
</p>
<p>
“I will not tell you what I did not do,” said the
angry child.
</p>
<p>
“You are vexed now and do not know what you
are saying. I will go away, and come back again
at the end of half an hour; perhaps you will tell me
then.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn stood silent. Miss Henderson, taking the
History with her, left the room. She turned the
key in the lock. Evelyn rushed to the window.
Could she get out by it? She rushed to the door
and tried to open it. Window and door defied her
efforts. She was locked in. She was like a wild
creature in a trap. To scream would do no good.
Never before had the spoilt child found herself in
such a position. A wild agony seized her; even now
she did not repent.
</p>
<p>
If only mothery were alive! If only she were
back on the ranch! If only Jasper were by her
side!
</p>
<p>
“Oh mothery! oh Jasper!” she cried; and then
a sob rose to her throat, tears burst from her eyes.
The tension for the time was relieved; she huddled up
in a chair, and sobbed as if her heart would break.
</p>
<p>
Miss Henderson came back again in half an hour.
Evelyn was still sobbing.
</p>
<p>
“Well, Evelyn,” she said, “I am just going into
the schoolroom now for prayers. Have you made
up your mind? Will you tell me why you did it, and
how you did it, and why you denied it? Just three
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288'></a>288</span>
questions, dear; answer truthfully, and you will have
got over the most painful and terrible crisis of your
life. Be brave, little girl; ask God to help you.”
</p>
<p>
“I cannot tell you what I do not know,” burst
now from the angry child. “Think what you like.
Do what you like. I am at your mercy; but I hate
you, and I will never be a good girl—never, never!
I will be a bad girl always—always; and I hate you—I
hate you!”
</p>
<p>
Miss Henderson did not speak a word. The most
violent passion cannot long retain its hold when the
person on whom its rage is spent makes no reply.
Even Evelyn cooled down a little. Miss Henderson
stood quite still; then she said gently:
</p>
<p>
“I am deeply sorry. I was prepared for this. It
will take more than this to subdue you.”
</p>
<p>
“Are you going into the schoolroom with those
scraps of paper, and are you going to tell all the
girls I am guilty?” said Evelyn.
</p>
<p>
“No, I shall not do that; I will give you another
chance. There was to have been a holiday to-day,
but because of that sin of yours there will be no
holiday. There was to be a visit on Saturday to the
museum at Chisfield, which the girls were all looking
forward to; they are not to go on account of
you. There were to be prizes at the break-up; they
will not be given on account of you. The girls will
not know that you are the cause of this deprivation,
but they will know that the deprivation is theirs because
there is a guilty person in the school, and
because she will not confess. Evelyn, I give you a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289'></a>289</span>
week from now to think this matter over. Remember,
my dear, that I know you are guilty; remember
that my sister Lucy knows it, and Miss Thompson;
but before you are publicly disgraced we wish to
give you a chance. We will treat you during the
week that has yet to run as we would any other girl
in the school. You will be treated until the week
is up as though you were innocent. Think well
whether you will indeed doom your companions to
so much disappointment as will be theirs during the
next week, to so dark a suspicion. During the next
week the school will practically be sent to Coventry.
Those who care for the girls will have to hold aloof
from them. All the parents will have to be written
to and told that there is an ugly suspicion hanging
over the school. Think well before you put your
companions, your schoolfellows, into this cruel
position.”
</p>
<p>
“It is you who are cruel,” said Evelyn.
</p>
<p>
“I must ask God to melt your hard heart, Evelyn.”
</p>
<p>
“And are you really going to do all this?”
</p>
<p>
“Certainly.”
</p>
<p>
“And at the end of the week?”
</p>
<p>
“If you have not confessed before then I shall be
obliged to confess for you before all the school.
But, my poor child, you will; you must make
amends. God could not have made so hard a
heart!”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn wiped away her tears. She scarcely knew
what she felt; she scarcely comprehended what was
going to happen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290'></a>290</span>
</p>
<p>
“May I bathe my eyes,” she said, “before I go
with you into the schoolroom?”
</p>
<p>
“You may. I will wait for you here.”
</p>
<p>
The little girl left the room.
</p>
<p>
“I never met such a character,” said Miss Henderson
to herself. “God help me, what am I to do
with her? If at the end of a week she has not confessed
her sin, I shall be obliged to ask Lady Frances
to remove her. Poor child—poor child!”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn came back looking pale but serene. She
held out her hand to Miss Henderson.
</p>
<p>
“I do not want your hand, Evelyn.”
</p>
<p>
“You said you would treat me for a week as if I
were innocent.”
</p>
<p>
“Very well, then; I will take your hand.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Henderson entered the schoolroom holding
Evelyn’s hand. Evelyn was looking as if nothing
had happened; the traces of her tears had vanished.
She sat down on her form; the other girls glanced at
her in some wonder. Prayers were read as usual;
the head-mistress knelt to pray. As her voice rose
on the wings of prayer it trembled slightly. She
prayed for those whose hearts were hard, that God
would soften them. She prayed that wrong might
be set right, that good might come out of evil, and
that she herself might be guided to have a right
judgment in all things. There was a great solemnity
in her prayer, and it was felt throughout the hush
in the big room. When she rose from her knees
she ascended to her desk and faced the assembled
girls.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291'></a>291</span>
</p>
<p>
“You know,” she said, “what an unpleasant task
lies before me. The allotted time for the confession
of the guilty person who injured my book, <em>Sesame
and Lilies</em>, has gone by. The guilty person has not
confessed, but I may as well say that the injury has
been traced home to one of your number—but to
whom, I am at present resolved not to tell. I give
that person one week in order to make her confession.
I do this for reasons which my sister and I
consider all-sufficient; but during that week, I am
sorry to say, my dear girls, you must all bear with her
and for her the penalty of her wrong-doing. I must
withhold indulgences, holidays, half-holidays, visits
from friends; all that makes life pleasant and bright
and home-like will have to be withdrawn. Work
will have to be the order of the hour—work without
the impetus of reward—work for the sake of
work. I am sorry to have to do this, but I feel that
such a course of conduct is due to myself. In a
week’s time from now, if the girl has not confessed,
I must take further steps; but I can assure the
school that the cloud of my displeasure will then alone
visit the guilty person, on whom it will fall with
great severity.”
</p>
<p>
There was a long, significant pause when Miss
Henderson ceased speaking. She was about to descend
from her seat when Brenda Fox spoke.
</p>
<p>
“Is this quite fair?” she said. “I hope I am not
asking an impertinent question, but is it fair that the
innocent should suffer for the guilty?”
</p>
<p>
“I must ask you all to do so. Think of the history
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292'></a>292</span>
of the past, girls. Take courage; it is not the first
time.”
</p>
<p>
“I think,” said Brenda Fox later on that same day
to Audrey, “that Miss Henderson is right.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I think her wrong,” answered Audrey.
“Of course I do not know her as well as you do,
Brenda, and I am also ignorant with regard to the
ordinary rules of school-life, but I cannot but feel it
would be much better, if the guilty girl will not
confess, to punish her at once and put an end to the
thing.”
</p>
<p>
“It would be pleasanter for us,” replied Brenda
Fox; “but then, Miss Henderson never thinks of
that.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?”
</p>
<p>
“I mean that Miss Henderson is the sort of
woman who would think very little of small personal
pain and inconvenience compared with the injury
which might be permanently inflicted on a girl who
was harshly dealt with.”
</p>
<p>
“Still I do not quite understand. If any girl in
the school did such a disgraceful thing it ought to be
known at once.”
</p>
<p>
“Miss Henderson evidently does know, but for
some reason she hopes the girl will repent.”
</p>
<p>
“And we are to be punished?”
</p>
<p>
“Is it not worth having a little discomfort if the
girl’s character can be saved?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, of course; if it does save her.”
</p>
<p>
“We must hope for that. For my part,” said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293'></a>293</span>
Brenda in a reverent tone, “I shall pray about it.
I believe in prayer.”
</p>
<p>
“And so do I,” answered Audrey. “But do you
know, Brenda, that I think Miss Henderson was
greatly wanting in tact when she mentioned my poor
little cousin’s name two days ago.”
</p>
<p>
“Why so? Your cousin did happen to be alone
in the room.”
</p>
<p>
“But it seemed to draw a very unworthy suspicion
upon her head.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh no, no, Audrey!” answered Brenda. “Who
could think that your cousin would do it? Besides,
she is quite a stranger; it was her first day at
school.”
</p>
<p>
“Then have you the least idea who did it?”
</p>
<p>
“None; no one has. We are all very fond of Miss
Thompson. We are all fond of Miss Henderson;
we respect her and Miss Lucy as most able and worthy
mistresses. We enjoy our school-life. Who could
have been so unkind?”
</p>
<p>
Audrey had an uncomfortable sensation at her
heart that Evelyn at least did not enjoy her school-life;
that Evelyn disliked Miss Thompson, and
openly said that she hated Miss Henderson. Still,
that Evelyn could really be guilty did not for an
instant visit her brain.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Evelyn went recklessly on her way.
The <em>dénouement</em>, of whatever nature, was still a week
off. For a week she could be gay or impertinent or
rude or defiant or good, just as the mood took her;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294'></a>294</span>
at the end of the week, or towards the end, she would
run away. She would go to Jasper and tell her she
must hide her. This was her resolve. She was as
inconsequent as an infant. To save herself trouble
and pain was her one paramount idea; even her
schoolfellows’ annoyance and distress scarcely worried
her. As she and Audrey always spent their
evenings at home, the dulness of the school, the increase
of lessons and the absence of play, the walks
two and two in absolute silence, scarcely depressed
her; she could laugh and play at home, and talk to
her uncle and draw him out to tell her stories of her
father. The one redeeming trait in her character
was her love for Uncle Edward. She was certainly
going downhill very rapidly at this time. Poor child!
who was there to understand her, to bring her to a
standstill, to help her to choose right?
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295'></a>295</span><a name='chXXIV' id='chXXIV'></a>CHAPTER XXIV.—“WHO IS E. W.?”</h2>
<p>
The one person who might have helped Evelyn
was too busy with her own troubles just then to think
a great deal about her. Poor Sylvia was visited
with a very great dread. Her father’s manner was
strange; she began to fear that he suspected Jasper’s
presence in the house. If Jasper left, Sylvia felt
that things must come to a crisis; she could not
stand the life she had lived before the comfortable
advent of this kindly but ill-informed woman. Sylvia
was really very much attached to Jasper, and although
she argued much over Evelyn, and disagreed
strongly with her with regard to the best way to
treat this unruly little member of society, Sylvia’s
very life depended on Jasper’s purse and Jasper’s
tact.
</p>
<p>
One by one the fowls disappeared, the same boy
receiving them over the hedge day by day from
Jasper. The boy sold each of the old hens for sixpence,
and reaped quite a harvest in consequence.
He was all too willing to keep Jasper’s secret.
Jasper bought tender young cockerels from a neighbor
in the village, conveyed them home under her
arm, killed them, and dressed them in various and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296'></a>296</span>
dainty manners for Mr. Leeson’s meals. He was
loud in his praise of Sylvia, and told her that if the
worst came to the worst she could go out as a lady
cook.
</p>
<p>
“Nothing could give me such horror, my dear
child,” he said, “as to think that a Leeson, and a
member of one of the proudest families in the kingdom,
should ever demean herself to earn money; but,
my dear girl, in these days of chance and change one
must be prepared for the worst—there never is any
telling. Sylvia, I go through anxious moments—very,
very anxious moments.”
</p>
<p>
“You do, father,” answered the girl. “You watch
the post too much. I cannot imagine,” she continued,
“why you are so fretted and so miserable, for
surely we must spend very, very little indeed.”
</p>
<p>
“We spend more than we ought, Sylvia—far more.
But there, dear, I am not complaining; I suppose a
young girl must have dainties and fine dress.”
</p>
<p>
“Fine dress!” said Sylvia. She looked down at
her shabby garment and colored painfully.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Leeson faced her with his bright and sunken
dark eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Come here,” he said.
</p>
<p>
She went up to him, trembling and her head
hanging.
</p>
<p>
“I saw you two days ago; it was Sunday, and
you went to church. I was standing in the shrubbery.
I was lost—yes, lost—in painful thoughts.
Those recipes which I was about to give to the world
were occupying my mind, and other things as well.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297'></a>297</span>
You rushed by in your shabby dress; you went into
the house by the back entrance. Sylvia dear, I
sometimes think it would be wise to lock that door.
With you and me alone in the house it might be
safest to have only one mode of ingress.”
</p>
<p>
“But I always lock it when I go out,” said Sylvia;
“and it saves so much time to be able to use the back
entrance.”
</p>
<p>
“It is just like you, Sylvia; you argue about
every thing I say. However, to proceed. You went
in; I wondered at your speed. You came out again
in a quarter of an hour transformed. Where did you
get that dress?”
</p>
<p>
“What dress, father?”
</p>
<p>
“Do not prevaricate. Look me straight in the
face and tell me. You were dressed in brown of
rich shade and good material. You had a stylish and
fanciful and hideous hat upon your head; it had
feathers. My very breath was arrested when I saw
the merry-andrew you made of yourself. You had
furs, too—doubtless imitations, but still, to all appearance,
rich furs—round neck and wrist. Sylvia,
have you during these months and years been
secretly saving money?”
</p>
<p>
“No, father.”
</p>
<p>
“You say ‘No, father,’ in a very strange tone.
If you had no money to buy the dress, how did you
get it?”
</p>
<p>
“It was—given to me.”
</p>
<p>
“By whom?”
</p>
<p>
“I would rather not say.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298'></a>298</span>
</p>
<p>
“But you must say.”
</p>
<p>
Here Mr. Leeson took Sylvia by both her wrists;
he held them tightly in his bony hands. He was
seated, and he pulled her down towards him.
</p>
<p>
“Tell me at once. I insist upon knowing.”
</p>
<p>
“I cannot—there! I will not.”
</p>
<p>
“You defy me?”
</p>
<p>
“If that is defying you, father, yes. The dress
was given to me.”
</p>
<p>
“You refuse to say by whom?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, father.”
</p>
<p>
“Then leave my presence. I am angry, hurt.
Sylvia, you must return it.”
</p>
<p>
“Again, no, father.”
</p>
<p>
“Sylvia, have you ever heard of the Fifth Commandment?”
</p>
<p>
“I have, father; but I will break it rather than
return the dress. I have been a good daughter to
you, but there are limits. You have no right to
interfere. The dress was given to me; I did not
steal it.”
</p>
<p>
“Now you are intolerable. I will not be agitated
by you; I have enough to bear. Leave me this
minute.”
</p>
<p>
Sylvia left the room. She did not go to Jasper;
she felt that she could not expose her father in the
eyes of this woman. She ran up to her own bedroom,
locked the door, and flung herself on her bed.
Of late she had not done this quite so often. Circumstances
had been happier for her of late: her father
had been strange, but at the same time affectionate;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299'></a>299</span>
she had been fed, too, and warmed; and, oh! the
pretty dress—the pretty dress—she had liked it.
She was determined that she would not give it up;
she would not submit to what she deemed tyranny.
She wept for a little; then she got up, dried her
tears, put on her cloak (sadly thin from wear), and
went out. Pilot came, looked into her face, and
begged for her company. She shook her head.
</p>
<p>
“No, darling; stay at home—guard him,” she
whispered.
</p>
<p>
Pilot understood, and turned away. Sylvia found
herself on the high-road. As she approached the
gate, and as she spoke to Pilot, eager eyes watched
her over the wire screen which protected the lower
part of Mr. Leeson’s sitting-room.
</p>
<p>
“What can all this mean?” he said to himself.
“There is a mystery about Sylvia. Sometimes I feel
that there is a mystery about this house. Sylvia
used to be a shocking cook; now the most dainty
chef who has ever condescended to cook meals for
my pampered palate can scarcely excel her. She
confessed that she did not get the recipe from the
gipsy; the gipsies had left the common, so she could
not get what I gave her a shilling to obtain. Or, did
I give her the shilling? I think not—I hope not.
Oh, good gracious! if I did, and she lost it! I did
not; I must have it here.”
</p>
<p>
He fumbled anxiously in his waistcoat pocket.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, yes,” he said, with a sigh of relief. “I put
it here for her, but she did not need it. Thank goodness,
it is safe!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300'></a>300</span>
</p>
<p>
He looked at it affectionately, replaced it in its
harbor of refuge, and thought on.
</p>
<p>
“Now, who gave her those rich and extravagant
clothes? Can she possibly have been ransacking her
mother’s trunks? I was under the impression that
I had sold all my poor wife’s things, but it is possible
I may have overlooked something. I will go and
have a look now in the attics. I had her trunks
conveyed there. I will go and have a look.”
</p>
<p>
When Mr. Leeson was engaged in what he was
pleased to call a voyage of discovery, he, as a rule,
stepped on tiptoe. As he wore, for purposes of
economy, felt slippers when in the house, his steps
made no noise. Now, it so happened that when
Jasper arrived at The Priory she brought not only
her own luggage, which was pretty considerable,
but two or three boxes of Evelyn’s finery. These
trunks having filled up Jasper’s bedroom and the
kitchens to an unnecessary extent, she and Sylvia
had contrived to drag them up to the attics in a
distant part of the house without Mr. Leeson hearing.
The trunks, therefore, mostly empty, which
had contained the late Mrs. Leeson’s wardrobe and
Evelyn’s trunks were now all together, in what was
known as the back attic—that attic which stood,
with Sylvia’s room between, exactly over the kitchen.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Leeson knew, as he imagined, every corner
of the house. He was well aware of the room
where his wife’s trunks were kept, and he went
there now, determined, as he expressed it, to ferret
out the mystery which was unsettling his life.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301'></a>301</span>
</p>
<p>
He reached the attic in question, and stared about
him. There were the trunks which he remembered
so well. Many marks of travel were on them—names
of foreign hotels, names of distant places.
Here was a trophy of a good time at Florence;
here a remembrance of a delightful fortnight at
Rome; here, again, of a week in Cairo; here, yet
more, of a never-to-be-forgotten visit to Constantinople.
He stared at the hall-marks of his past life
as he gazed at his wife’s trunks, and for a time
memory overpowered the lonely man, and he stood
with his hands clasped and his head slightly bent,
thinking—thinking of the days that were no more.
No remorse, it is true, seized his conscience. He
did not recognize how, step by step, the demon of
his life had gained more and more power over him;
how the trunks became too shabby for use, but the
desire for money prevented his buying new ones.
Those labels were old, and the places he and his
wife had visited were much changed, and the hotels
where they had stayed had many of them ceased to
exist, but the labels put on by the hall porters remained
on the trunks and bore witness against Mr.
Leeson. He turned quickly from the sight.
</p>
<p>
“This brings back old times,” he said to himself,
“and old times create old feelings. I never knew
then that she would be cursed by the demon of extravagance,
and that her child—her only child—would
inherit her failing. Well, it is my bounden
duty to nip it in the bud, or Sylvia will end her
days in the workhouse. I thought I had sold most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302'></a>302</span>
of the clothes, but doubtless she found some materials
to make up that unsuitable costume.”
</p>
<p>
He dragged the trunks forward. They were unlocked,
being supposed to contain nothing of value.
He pulled them open and went on his knees to examine
them. Most of them were empty; some contained
old bundles of letters; there was one in the
corner which still had a couple of muslin dresses
and an old-fashioned black lace mantilla. Mr. Leeson
remembered the mantilla and the day when he
bought it, and how pretty his handsome wife had
looked in it. He flung it from him now as if it distressed
him.
</p>
<p>
“Faugh!” he said. “I remember I gave ten
guineas for it. Think of any man being such a
fool!”
</p>
<p>
He was about to leave the attic, more mystified
than ever, when his eyes suddenly fell upon the two
trunks which contained that portion of Evelyn
Wynford’s wardrobe which Lady Frances had discarded.
The trunks were comparatively new.
They were handsome and good, being made of
crushed cane. They bore the initials E. W. in large
white letters on their arched roofs.
</p>
<p>
“But who in the name of fortune is E. W.?”
thought Mr. Leeson; and now his heart beat in ungovernable
excitement. “E. W.! What can those
initials stand for?”
</p>
<p>
He came close to the trunks as though they fascinated
him. They were unlocked, and he pulled them
open. Soon Evelyn’s gay and useless wardrobe was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303'></a>303</span>
lying helter-skelter on the attic floor—silk dresses,
evening dresses, morning dresses, afternoon dresses,
furs, hats, cloaks, costumes. He kicked them about
in his rage; his anger reached white-heat. What
was the meaning of this?
</p>
<p>
E. W. and E. W.’s clothes took such an effect on
his brain that he could scarcely speak or think. He
left the attic with all the things scattered about, and
stumbled rather than walked down-stairs. He had
nearly got to his own part of the house when he
remembered something. He went back, turned the
key in the attic door, and put it in his pocket. He
then breathed a sigh of relief, and went back to his
sitting-room. The fire was nearly out; the day
was colder than ever—a keen north wind was blowing.
It came in at the badly fitting windows and
shook the old panes of glass. The attic in which
Mr. Leeson had stood so long had also been icy-cold.
He shivered and crept close to the remains of the
fire. Then a thought came to him, and he deliberately
took up the poker and poked out the
remaining embers. They flamed up feebly on the
hearth and died out.
</p>
<p>
“No more fires for me,” he said to himself; “I
cannot afford it. She is ruining—ruining me. Who
is E. W.? Where did she get all those clothes?
Oh, I shall go mad!”
</p>
<p>
He stood shivering and frowning and muttering.
Then a change came over him.
</p>
<p>
“There is a secret, and I mean to discover it,” he
said to himself; “and until I do I shall say nothing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304'></a>304</span>
I shall find out who E. W. is, where those trunks
came from, what money Sylvia stole to purchase
those awful and ridiculous and terrible garments.
I shall find out before I act. Sylvia thinks that she
can make a fool of her old father; she will discover
her mistake.”
</p>
<p>
The postman’s ring was heard at the gate. The
postman was never allowed to go up the avenue.
Mr. Leeson kept a box locked in the gate, with a
little slit for the postman to drop in the letters.
He allowed no one to open this box but himself.
Without even putting on his greatcoat, he went
down the snowy path now, unlocked the box, and
took out a letter. He returned with it to the
house; it was addressed to himself, and was from
his broker in London. The letter contained news
which affected him pretty considerably. The gold
mine in which he had invested nearly the whole of
his available capital was discovered to be by no
means so rich in ore as was at first anticipated.
Prices were going down steadily, and the shares
which Mr. Leeson had bought were now worth only
half their value.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll sell out—I’ll sell out this minute,” thought
the wretched man; “if I don’t I shall lose all.”
</p>
<p>
But then he paused, for there was a postscript to
the letter.
</p>
<p>
“It would be madness to sell now,” wrote the
broker. “Doubtless the present scare is a passing
one; the moment the shares are likely to go up
then sell.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305'></a>305</span>
</p>
<p>
Mr. Leeson flung the letter from him and tore his
gray hair. He paced up and down the room.
</p>
<p>
“Disaster after disaster,” he murmured. “I am
like Job; all these things are against me. But
nothing cuts me like Sylvia. To buy those things—two
trunks full of useless finery! Oh yes, I have
money on the premises—money which I saved and
never invested; I wonder if that is safe. For all I
can tell——But, oh, no, no, no! I will not think
that. That way madness lies. I will bury the
canvas bag to-night; I have delayed too long. No
one can discover that hiding-place. I will bury the
canvas bag, come what may, to-night.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Leeson wrote to his broker, telling him to
seize the first propitious moment to sell out from the
gold-mine, and then sat moodily, getting colder and
colder, in front of the empty grate.
</p>
<p>
Sylvia came in presently.
</p>
<p>
“Dinner is ready, father,” she said.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t want dinner,” he muttered.
</p>
<p>
She went up to him and laid her hand on his arm.
</p>
<p>
“Why are you like ice?” she said.
</p>
<p>
He pushed her away.
</p>
<p>
“The fire is out,” she continued; “let me light it.”
</p>
<p>
“No!” he thundered. “Leave it alone; I wish
for no fire. I tell you I am a beggar, and worse;
and I wish for no fire!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh father—father darling!” said the girl.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t ‘darling’ me; don’t come near me. I
am displeased with you. You have cut me to the
quick. I am angry with you. Leave me.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306'></a>306</span>
</p>
<p>
“You may be angry,” she answered, “but I will
not leave you ; and if you are cold—cold to death—and
cannot afford a fire, you will warm yourself with
me. Let me put my arms round you; let me lay
my cheek against yours. Feel how my cheek glows.
There, is not that better?”
</p>
<p>
He struggled, but she insisted. She sat on his
knee now and put the cloak she was wearing, thin
and poor enough in itself, round his neck. Inside
the cloak she circled him with her arms. Her dark
luxuriant hair fell against his white and scanty
locks; she pressed her face close to his.
</p>
<p>
“You may hate me, but I am going to stay with
you,” she said. “How cold you are!”
</p>
<p>
Just for a minute or two Mr. Leeson bore the
loving caress and the endearing words. She was
very sweet, and she was his—his only child—bone of
his bone. Yes, it was nicer to be warm than cold,
nicer to be loved than to be hated, nicer to——But
was he loved? Those trunks up-stairs; that
costly, useless finery; those initials which were not
Sylvia’s!
</p>
<p>
“Oh that I could tell her!” he said to himself.
“She pretends; she is untrue—untrue as our first
mother. What woman was ever yet to be trusted?”
</p>
<p>
“Go, Sylvia,” he replied vehemently; and he
started up and shook her off cruelly, so that she
fell and hurt herself.
</p>
<p>
She rose, pushed her hair back from her forehead
and gazed at him in bewilderment. Was he going
mad?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307'></a>307</span>
</p>
<p>
“Come and eat your dinner before it gets cold,”
she said. “It is extravagant to waste good food;
come and eat it.”
</p>
<p>
“Made from some of those old fowls?” he queried;
and a scornful smile curled his lips.
</p>
<p>
“Come and eat it; it costs you practically nothing,”
she added. “Come, it is extravagant to
waste it.”
</p>
<p>
He pondered in his own mind; there were still
about three fowls left. He would not take her hand
but he followed her into the dining-room. He sat
down before the dainty dish, helped her to a small
portion, and ate the rest.
</p>
<p>
“Now you are better,” she said cheerfully.
</p>
<p>
He gave her a glance which seemed to her to be
one of almost venom.
</p>
<p>
“I am going into my sitting-room,” he said; “do
not disturb me again to-day.”
</p>
<p>
“But you must have a fire!”
</p>
<p>
“I decline to have a fire.”
</p>
<p>
“You will die of cold.”
</p>
<p>
“Much you care.”
</p>
<p>
“Father!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Sylvia, much you care; you are like the
one who gave you being. I will not say any more.”
</p>
<p>
She started away at this; he knew she would.
She was patient with him almost beyond the limits
of human patience, but she could not stand having
her mother abused.
</p>
<p>
He went down the passage, and locked himself in
his sitting-room.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308'></a>308</span>
</p>
<p>
“Now I can think,” he thought; “and to-night
when Sylvia is in bed I will bury the last canvas
bag.”
</p>
<p>
When Sylvia went into the kitchen Jasper asked
her at once what was the matter. She stood for a
moment without speaking; then she said in a low,
broken-hearted voice:
</p>
<p>
“Father sometimes gets these moods, but I never
saw him as bad before. He refuses to have a fire in
the parlor; he will die of this cold.”
</p>
<p>
“Let him,” muttered Jasper under her breath.
She did not say these words aloud; she knew Sylvia
too well by this time.
</p>
<p>
“What has put him into this state of mind?” she
asked as she dished up a hot dinner for Sylvia and
herself.
</p>
<p>
“It was my dress, Jasper; I ought not to have
allowed you to make it for me. I ran in to put it
on to go to church on Sunday; and he saw me
and drew his own conclusions, as he said. He asked
me where I got it, and I refused to tell him.”
</p>
<p>
“Now, if I were you, dear,” said Jasper, “I
would just up and tell him the whole story. I
would tell him that I am here, and that I mean to
stay, and that he has been living on me for some
time now. I would tell him everything. He would
rage and fume, but not more than he has raged and
fumed. Things are past bearing, darling. Why,
your pretty, young, and brave heart will be broken.
I would not bear it. It is best for him too, dear;
he must learn to know you, and if necessary to fear
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309'></a>309</span>
you. He cannot go on killing himself and every
one else with impunity. It is past bearing, Sylvia,
my love—past bearing.”
</p>
<p>
“I know, Jasper—I know—but I dare not tell
him. You cannot imagine what he is when he is
really roused. He would turn you out.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, darling, and you would come with me.
Why should we not go out?”
</p>
<p>
“In the first place, Jasper, you have no money to
support us both. Why, poor, dear old thing, you are
using up all your little savings to keep me going!
And in the next place, even if you could afford it,
I promised mother that I would never leave him.
I could not break my word to her. Oh! it hurt
much; but the pain is over. I will never leave
him while he lives, Jasper.”
</p>
<p>
“Dear, dear!” said Jasper, “what a power of love
is wasted on worthless people! It is the most
extraordinary fact on earth.”
</p>
<p>
Sylvia half-smiled. She thought of Evelyn, who
was also in her opinion more or less worthless, and
how Jasper was wasting both substance and heart
on her.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” she said, “I can eat if I can do nothing
else ; but the thought of father dying of cold does
come between me and all peace.”
</p>
<p>
She finished her dinner, and then went and stood
by the window.
</p>
<p>
“It is a perfect miracle he has not found me out
before,” said Jasper; “and, by the same token,” she
added, “I heard footsteps in the attic up-stairs while
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310'></a>310</span>
I was preparing his fowl for dinner. My heart stood
still. It must have been he; and I thought he
would see the smoke curling up through that stack
of chimneys just alongside of the attics. What was
he doing up stairs?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I know—I know!” said Sylvia; and her
face turned very white, and her eyes seemed to
start from her head. “He went to look in mother’s
trunks; he thought that I had got my brown dress
from there.”
</p>
<p>
“And he will discover Evelyn’s trunks as sure as
fate,” said Jasper; “and what a state he will be in!
That accounts for it, Sylvia. Well, darling, discovery
is imminent now; and for my part the sooner
it is over the better.”
</p>
<p>
“I wonder if he did discover! Something has put
him into a terrible rage,” thought the girl.
</p>
<p>
She went out of the kitchen, and stole softly
up-stairs to the attic where the trunks were kept.
It was locked. Doubt was now, of course, at an
end. Sylvia went back and told her discovery to
Jasper.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311'></a>311</span><a name='chXXV' id='chXXV'></a>CHAPTER XXV.—UNCLE EDWARD.</h2>
<p>
According to her promise, Jasper went that evening
to meet Evelyn at the stile. Evelyn was there,
and the news she had for her faithful nurse was the
reverse of soothing.
</p>
<p>
“You cannot stand it,” said Jasper; “you cannot
demean yourself. I don’t know that I’d have done
it—yes, perhaps I would—but having done it, you
must stick to your guns.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Evelyn in a mournful tone; “I must
run away. I have quite, quite, absolutely made up
my mind.”
</p>
<p>
“And when, darling?” said Jasper, trembling a
good deal.
</p>
<p>
“The night before the week is up. I will come to
you here, Jasper, and you must take me.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course, love; you will come back with me to
The Priory. I can hide you there as well as anywhere
on earth—yes, love, as well as anywhere on
earth.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’d be so frightened! It would be so close
to them all!”
</p>
<p>
“The closer the better, dear. If you went into
any village or any town near you would be discovered;
but they’d never think of looking for you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312'></a>312</span>
at The Priory. Why, darling, I have lived there
unsuspected for some time now—weeks, I might
say. Sylvia will not tell. You shall sleep in my
bed, and I will keep you safe. Only you must
bring some money, Evelyn, for mine is getting sadly
short.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Evelyn. “I will ask Uncle Edward;
he will not refuse me. He is very kind to me, and
I love him better than any one on earth—better
even than Jasper, because he is father’s very own
brother, and because I am his heiress. He likes to
talk to me about the place and what I am to do
when it belongs to me. He is not angry with me
when I am quite alone with him and I talk of these
things; only he has taught me to say nothing about
it in public. If I could be sorry for having got into
this scrape it would be on his account; but there, I
was not brought up with his thoughts, and I cannot
think things wrong that he thinks wrong. Can you,
Jasper?”
</p>
<p>
“No, my little wild honey-bird—not I. Well,
dearie, I will meet you again to-morrow night; and
now I must be going back.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn returned to the house. She went up to
her room, changed her shoes, tidied her hair, and
came down to the drawing-room. Lady Frances was
leaning back in a chair, turning over the pages of
a new magazine. She called Evelyn to her side.
</p>
<p>
“How do you like school?” she said. Her tones
were abrupt; the eyes she fixed on the child were
hard.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313'></a>313</span>
</p>
<p>
Evelyn’s worst feelings were always awakened by
Lady Frances’s manner to her.
</p>
<p>
“I do not like it at all,” she said. “I wish to
leave.”
</p>
<p>
“Your wishes, I am afraid, are not to be considered;
all the same, you may have to leave.”
</p>
<p>
“Why?” asked Evelyn, turning white. She wondered
if Lady Frances knew.
</p>
<p>
Her aunt’s eyes were fixed, as though they were
gimlets, on her face.
</p>
<p>
“Sit down,” said Lady Frances, “and tell me how
you spend your day. What class are you in? What
lessons are you learning?”
</p>
<p>
“I am in a very low class indeed?” said Evelyn.
“Mothery always said I was clever.”
</p>
<p>
“I do not suppose your mother knew.”
</p>
<p>
“Why should she not know, she who was so very
clever herself? She taught me all sorts of things,
and so did poor Jasper.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah! I am glad at least that I have removed
that dreadful woman out of your path,” said Lady
Frances.
</p>
<p>
Evelyn smiled and lowered her eyes. Her manner
irritated her aunt extremely.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” she said, “go on; we will not discuss the
fact of the form you ought to be in. What lessons
do you do?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, history, grammar; I suppose, the usual English
subjects.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, yes; but history—that is interesting. English
history?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314'></a>314</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Aunt Frances.”
</p>
<p>
“What part of the history?”
</p>
<p>
“We are doing the reigns of the Edwards now.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah! can you tell me anything with regard to
the reign of Edward I.?”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn colored. Lady Frances watched her.
</p>
<p>
“I am certain she knows,” thought the little girl.
“But, oh, this is terrible! Has that awful Miss
Henderson told her? What shall I do? I do not
think I will wait until the week is up; I think I will
run away at once.”
</p>
<p>
“Answer my question, Evelyn,” said her aunt.
</p>
<p>
Evelyn did mutter a tiny piece of information with
regard to the said reign.
</p>
<p>
“I shall question you on your history from time
to time,” said Lady Frances. “I take an interest in
this school experiment. Whether it will last or not
I cannot say; but I may as well say one thing—if
for any reason your presence is not found suitable in
the school where I have now sent you, you will go to
a very different order of establishment and to a much
stricter <em>régime</em> elsewhere.”
</p>
<p>
“What is a <em>régime?</em>” asked Evelyn.
</p>
<p>
“I am too tired to answer your silly questions.
Now go and read your book in that corner. Do not
make a noise; I have a headache.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn slouched away, looking as cross and ill-tempered
as a little girl could look.
</p>
<p>
“Audrey darling,” called her mother in a totally
different tone of voice, “play me that pretty thing
of Chopin’s which you know I am so fond of.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315'></a>315</span>
</p>
<p>
Audrey approached the piano and began to play.
</p>
<p>
Evelyn read her book for a time without attending
much to the meaning of the words. Then she
observed that her uncle, who had been asleep behind
his newspaper, had risen and left the room. Here
was the very opportunity that she sought. If she
could only get her Uncle Edward quite by himself,
and when he was in the best of good humors, he
might give her some money. She could not run
away without money to go with. Jasper, she knew,
had not a large supply. Evelyn, with all her ignorance
of many things, had early in her life come into
contact with the want of money. Her mother had
often and often been short of funds. When Mrs.
Wynford was short, the ranch did without even, at
times, the necessaries of life. Evelyn had a painful
remembrance of butterless breakfasts and meatless
dinners; of shoes which were patched so often that
they would scarcely keep out the winter snows; of
little garments turned and turned again. Then
money had come back, and life became smooth and
pleasant; there was an abundance of good food for
the various meals, and Evelyn had shoes to her
heart’s content, and the sort of gay-colored garments
which her mother delighted in. Yes, she understood
Jasper’s appeal for money, and determined on
no account to go to that good woman’s protection
without a sufficient sum in hand.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, as Audrey was playing some of the
most seductive music of that past master of the art,
Chopin, and Lady Frances lay back in her chair
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316'></a>316</span>
with closed eyes and listened, Evelyn left the room.
She knew where to find her uncle, and going down
a corridor, opened the door of his smoking-room
without knocking. He was seated by the fire smoking.
A newspaper lay by his side; a pile of letters
which had come by the evening post were waiting to
be opened. When Evelyn quietly opened the door
he looked round and said:
</p>
<p>
“Ah, it is you, Eve. Do you want anything, my
dear?”
</p>
<p>
“May I speak to you for a minute or two, Uncle
Edward?”
</p>
<p>
“Certainly, my dear Evelyn; come in. What is
the matter, dear?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, nothing much.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn went and leant up against her uncle. She
had never a scrap of fear of him, which was one
reason why he liked her, and thought her far more
tolerable than did his wife or Audrey. Even Audrey,
who was his own child, held him in a certain awe;
but Evelyn leant comfortably now against his side,
and presently she took his arm of her own accord
and passed it securely round her waist.
</p>
<p>
“Now, that is nice,” she said; “when I lean up
against you I always remember that you are father’s
brother.”
</p>
<p>
“I am glad that you should remember that fact,
Evelyn.”
</p>
<p>
“You are pleased with me on the whole, aren’t
you, Uncle Edward?” asked the little girl. Evelyn
backed her head against his shoulder as she spoke,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317'></a>317</span>
and looked into his face with her big and curious
eyes.
</p>
<p>
“On the whole, yes.”
</p>
<p>
“But Aunt Frances does not like me.”
</p>
<p>
“You must try to win her affection, Evelyn; it
will all come in good time.”
</p>
<p>
“It is not pleasant to be in the house with a person
who does not like you, is it, Uncle Edward?”
</p>
<p>
“I can understand you, Evelyn; it is not pleasant.”
</p>
<p>
“And Audrey only half-likes me.”
</p>
<p>
“My dear little girl,” said her uncle, rousing himself
to talk in a more serious strain, “would it not
be wisest for you to give over thinking of who likes
you and who does not, and to devote all your time to
doing what is right?”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn made a wry face.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t care about doing what is right,” she
said; “I don’t like it.”
</p>
<p>
Her uncle smiled.
</p>
<p>
“You are a strange girl; but I believe you have
improved,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“You would be sorry if I did anything very,
very naughty, Uncle Edward?”
</p>
<p>
“I certainly should.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn lowered her eyes.
</p>
<p>
“He must not know. I must keep him from
knowing somehow, but I wonder how I shall,” she
thought.
</p>
<p>
“And perhaps you would be sorry,” she continued,
“if I were not here—if your naughty, naughty Eve
was no longer in the house?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318'></a>318</span>
</p>
<p>
“I should. I often think of you. I——”
</p>
<p>
“What, Uncle Edward?”
</p>
<p>
“Love you, little girl.”
</p>
<p>
“Love me! Do you?” she asked in a tone of
affection. “Do you really? Please say that again.”
</p>
<p>
“I love you, Evelyn.”
</p>
<p>
“Uncle Edward, may I give you just the tiniest
kiss?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, dear.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn raised her soft face and pressed a light
kiss on her uncle’s cheek. She was quite silent then
for a minute; truth to tell, her heart was expanding
and opening out and softening, and great thrills
of pure love were filling it, so that soon, soon that
heart might have melted utterly and been no longer
a hard heart of stone. But, alas! as these good
thoughts visited her, there came also the remembrance
of the sin she had committed, and of the
desperate measures she was about to take to save
herself—for she had by no means come to the stage
of confessing that sin, and by so doing getting rid of
her naughtiness.
</p>
<p>
“Uncle Edward,” she said abruptly, “I want you
to give me a little money. I have come here to ask
you. I want it all for my very own self. I want
some money which no one else need know anything
about.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course, dear, you shall have money. How much
do you want?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, a good bit. I want to give Jasper a
present.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319'></a>319</span>
</p>
<p>
“Your old nurse?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. You know it was unkind of Aunt Frances
to send her away; mothery wished her to stay
with me.”
</p>
<p>
“I know that, Evelyn, and as far as I personally
am concerned, I am sorry; but your aunt knows very
much more about little girls than I do.”
</p>
<p>
“She does not know half so much about this
girl.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, anyhow, dear, it was her wish, and you
and I must submit.”
</p>
<p>
“But you are sorry?”
</p>
<p>
“For some reasons, yes.”
</p>
<p>
“And you would like me to help Jasper?”
</p>
<p>
“Certainly. Do you know where your nurse is
now, Evelyn?”
</p>
<p>
“I do.”
</p>
<p>
“Where?”
</p>
<p>
“I would rather not say; only, may I send her
some money?”
</p>
<p>
“That seems reasonable enough,” thought the
Squire.
</p>
<p>
“How much do you want?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“Would twenty pounds be too much?”
</p>
<p>
“I think not. It is a good deal, but she was a
faithful servant. I will give you twenty pounds for
her now.”
</p>
<p>
The Squire rose and took out his check-book.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, please,” said Evelyn, “I want it in gold.”
</p>
<p>
“But how will you send it to her?”
</p>
<p>
“Never, never mind; I must have it in gold.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320'></a>320</span>
</p>
<p>
“Poor child! She is in earnest,” thought the
Squire. “Perhaps the woman will come to meet her
somewhere. I really cannot see why she should be
tabooed from having a short interview with her old
nurse. Frances and I differ on this head. Yes, I
will let her have the money; the child has a good
deal of heart when all is said and done.”
</p>
<p>
So the Squire put two little rolls, neatly made up
in brown paper, into Evelyn’s hands.
</p>
<p>
“There,” he said; “it is a great deal of money to
trust a little girl with, but you shall have it; only
you must not ask me for any more.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, what a darling you are, Uncle Edward!
I feel as if I must kiss you again. There! those
kisses are full of love. Now I must go. But, oh,
I say, <em>what</em> a funny parcel!”
</p>
<p>
“What parcel, dear?”
</p>
<p>
“That long parcel on that table.”
</p>
<p>
“It is a gun-case which I have not yet unpacked.
Now run away.”
</p>
<p>
“But that reminds me. You said I might go out
some day to shoot with you.”
</p>
<p>
“On some future day. I do not much care for
girls using firearms; and you are so busy now with
your school.”
</p>
<p>
“You think, perhaps, that I cannot fire a gun,
but I can aim well; I can kill a bird on the wing as
neatly as any one. I told Audrey, and she would
not believe me. Please—please show me your new
gun.
</p>
<p>
“Not now; I have not looked at it myself yet.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321'></a>321</span>
</p>
<p>
“But you do believe that I can shoot?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh yes, dear—yes, I suppose so. All the same,
I should be sorry to trust you; I do not approve of
women carrying firearms. Now leave me, Evelyn;
I have a good deal to attend to.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn went to bed to think over her uncle’s
words; her disgrace at school; the terrible <em>dénouement</em>
which lay before her; the money, which seemed
to her to be the only way out, and which would
insure her comfort with Jasper wherever Jasper
might like to take her; and finally, and by no means
least, she meditated over the subject of her uncle’s
new gun. On the ranch she had often carried a gun
of her own; from her earliest days she had been
accustomed to regard the women of her family as
first-class shots. Her mother had herself taught
her how to aim, how to fire, how to make allowance
in order to bring her bird down on the wing,
and Evelyn had followed out her instructions many
times. She felt now that her uncle did not believe
her, and the fear that this was the case irritated her
beyond words.
</p>
<p>
“I do not pretend to be learned,” thought Evelyn,
“and I do not pretend to be good, but there is one
thing that I am, and that is a first-rate shot. Uncle
Edward might show me his new gun. How little
he guesses that I can manage it quite as well as he
can himself!”
</p>
<p>
Two or three days passed without anything special
occurring. Evelyn was fairly good at school; it was
not, she considered, worth her while any longer to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322'></a>322</span>
shirk her lessons. She began in spite of herself, and
quite against her declared inclination, to have a
sort of liking for her books. History was the only
lesson which she thoroughly detested. She could
not be civil to Miss Thompson, whom she considered
her enemy; but to her other teachers she was fairly
agreeable, and had already to a certain extent won
the hearts of more than one of the girls in her form.
She was bright and cheerful, and could say funny
things; and as also she brought an unlimited supply
of chocolates and other sweetmeats to school,
these facts alone insured her being more or less of
a favorite. At home she avoided her aunt and
Audrey, and evening after evening she went to the
stile to have a chat with Jasper.
</p>
<p>
Jasper never failed to meet her little girl, as she
called Evelyn, at their arranged rendezvous. Evelyn
managed to slip out without, as she thought, any
one noticing her; and the days went by until there
was only one day left before Miss Henderson would
proclaim to the entire school that Evelyn Wynford
was the guilty person who had torn the precious
volume of Ruskin.
</p>
<p>
“When you come for me to-morrow night, Jasper,”
said Evelyn, “I will go away with you. Are you
quite sure that it is safe to take me back to The
Priory?”
</p>
<p>
“Quite, quite safe, darling; hardly a soul knows
that I am at The Priory, and certainly no one will
suspect that you are there. Besides, the place is all
undermined with cellars, and at the worst you and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323'></a>323</span>
I could hide there together while the house was
searched.”
</p>
<p>
“What fun!” cried Evelyn, clapping her hands.
“I declare, Jasper, it is almost as good as a fairy
story.”
</p>
<p>
“Quite as good, my little love.”
</p>
<p>
“And you will be sure to have a very, very nice
supper ready for me to-morrow night?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh yes, dear; just the supper you like best—chocolate
and sweet cakes.”
</p>
<p>
“And you will tuck me up in bed as you used to?”
</p>
<p>
“Darling, I have put a little white bed close to my
own, where you shall sleep.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh Jasper, it will be nice to be with you again!
And you are positive Sylvia will not tell?”
</p>
<p>
“She is sad about you, Evelyn, but she will not
tell. I have arranged that.”
</p>
<p>
“And that terrible old man, her father, will he
find out?”
</p>
<p>
“I think not, dear; he has not yet found out about
me at any rate.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps, Jasper, I had better go back now; it is
later than usual.”
</p>
<p>
“Be sure you bring the twenty pounds when you
come to-morrow night,” said Jasper; “for my funds,
what with one thing and another, are getting low.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I will bring the money,” replied Evelyn.
</p>
<p>
She returned to the house. No one saw her as
she slipped in by the back entrance. She ran up to
her room, smoothed her hair, and went down to the
drawing-room. Lady Frances and Audrey were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324'></a>324</span>
alone in the big room. They had been talking together,
but instantly became silent when Evelyn
entered.
</p>
<p>
“They have been abusing me, of course,” thought
the little girl; and she flashed an angry glance first
at one and then at the other.
</p>
<p>
“Evelyn,” said her aunt, “have you finished learning
your lessons? You know how extremely particular
Miss Henderson is that school tasks should
be perfectly prepared.”
</p>
<p>
“My lessons are all right, thank you,” replied
Evelyn in her brusquest voice. She flung herself
into a chair and crossed her legs.
</p>
<p>
“Uncross your legs, my dear; that is a very
unlady-like thing to do.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn muttered something, but did what her
aunt told her.
</p>
<p>
“Do not lean back so much, Evelyn; it is not
good style. Do not poke out your chin, either;
observe how Audrey sits.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t want to observe how Audrey sits,” said
Evelyn.
</p>
<p>
Lady Frances colored. She was about to speak,
but a glance from her daughter restrained her. Just
then Read came into the room. Between Read and
Evelyn there was already a silent feud. Read now
glanced at the young lady, tossed her head a trifle,
and went up to Lady Frances.
</p>
<p>
“I am very sorry to trouble you, madam,” she
said, “but if I may see you quite by yourself for a
few moments I shall be very much obliged.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325'></a>325</span>
</p>
<p>
“Certainly, Read; go into my boudoir and I will
join you there,” said her mistress. “I know,” added
Lady Frances graciously, “that you would not disturb
me if you had not something important to say.”
</p>
<p>
“No, madam; I should be very sorry to do so.”
</p>
<p>
Lady Frances and Read now left the room, and
Audrey and Evelyn were alone. Audrey uttered a
sigh.
</p>
<p>
“What is the matter, Audrey?” asked her cousin.
</p>
<p>
“I am thinking of the day after to-morrow,”
answered Audrey. “The unhappy girl who has kept
her secret all this time will be openly denounced.
It will be terribly exciting.”
</p>
<p>
“You do not pretend that you pity her!” said
Evelyn in a voice of scorn.
</p>
<p>
“Indeed I do pity her.”
</p>
<p>
“What nonsense! That is not at all your way.”
</p>
<p>
“Why should you say that? It is my way. I
pity all people who have done wrong most terribly.”
</p>
<p>
“Then have you ever pitied me since I came to
England?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh yes, Evelyn—oh, indeed I have!”
</p>
<p>
“Please keep your pity to yourself; I don’t
want it.”
</p>
<p>
Audrey relapsed into silence.
</p>
<p>
By and by Lady Frances came back; she was still
accompanied by Read.
</p>
<p>
“What does a servant want in this room?” said
Evelyn in her most disagreeable voice.
</p>
<p>
“Evelyn, come here,” said her aunt; “I have
something to say to you.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326'></a>326</span>
</p>
<p>
Evelyn went very unwillingly. Read stood a little
in the background.
</p>
<p>
“Evelyn,” said Lady Frances, “I have just heard
something that surprises me extremely, that pains
me inexpressibly; it is true, so there is no use in your
denying it, but I must tell you what Read has discovered.”
</p>
<p>
“Read!” cried Evelyn, her voice choking with
passion and her face white. “Who believes what a
tell-tale-tit of that sort says?”
</p>
<p>
“You must not be impertinent, my dear. I wish
to tell you that Read has found you out. Your maid
Jasper has not left this neighborhood, and you, Evelyn—you
are naughty enough and daring enough
to meet her every night by the stile that leads into
the seven-acre meadow. Read observed your absence
one night, and followed you herself to-night,
and she discovered everything.”
</p>
<p>
“Did you hear what I was saying to Jasper?”
asked Evelyn, turning her white face now and looking
full at Read.
</p>
<p>
“No, Miss Evelyn,” replied the maid; “I would
not demean myself to listen.”
</p>
<p>
“You would demean yourself to follow,” said
Evelyn.
</p>
<p>
“Confess your sin, Evelyn, and do not scold Read,”
interrupted Lady Frances.
</p>
<p>
“I have nothing to confess, Aunt Frances.”
</p>
<p>
“But you did it?”
</p>
<p>
“Certainly I did it.”
</p>
<p>
“You dared to go to meet a woman privately,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327'></a>327</span>
clandestinely, whom I, your aunt, prohibited the
house?”
</p>
<p>
“I dared to go to meet the woman my mother
loved,” replied Evelyn, “and I am not a bit ashamed
of it; and if I had the chance I would do it again.”
</p>
<p>
“You are a very, very naughty girl. I am more
than angry with you. I am pained beyond words.
What is to become of you I know not. You are a
bad girl; I cannot bear to think that you should be
in the same house with Audrey.”
</p>
<p>
“Loving the woman whom my mother loved does
not make me a bad girl,” replied Evelyn. “But as
you do not like to have me in the room, Aunt Frances,
I will go away—I will go up-stairs. I think you are
very, very unkind to me; I think you have been so
from the first.”
</p>
<p>
“Do not dare to say another word to me, miss;
go away immediately.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn left the room. She was half-way up-stairs
when she paused.
</p>
<p>
“What is the use of being good?” she said to
herself. “What is the use of ever trying to please
anybody? I really did not mean to be naughty
when first I came, and if Aunt Frances had been
different I might have been different too. What
right had she to deprive me of Jasper when mothery
said that Jasper was to stay with me? It is Aunt
Frances’s fault that I am such a bad girl now. Well,
thank goodness! I shall not be here much longer; I
shall be away this time to-morrow night. The only
person I shall be sorry to leave is Uncle Edward.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328'></a>328</span>
Audrey and I will be going to school early in the
morning, and then there will be the fuss and bustle
and the getting away before Read sees me. Oh,
that dreadful old Read! what can I do to blind her
eyes to-morrow night? Throw dust into them in
some fashion I must. I will just go and have one
word of good-by with Uncle Edward now.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn ran down the corridor which led to her
uncle’s room. She tapped at the door. There was
no answer. She opened the door softly and peeped
in. The room was empty. She was just about to
go away again, considerably crestfallen and disappointed,
when her eyes fell upon the gun-case. Instantly
a sparkle came into her eyes; she went up to
the case, and removing the gun, proceeded to examine
it. It was made on the newest pattern, and
was light and easily carried. It held six chambers,
all of which could be most simply and conveniently
loaded.
</p>
<p>
Evelyn knew well how to load a gun, and finding
the proper cartridges, now proceeded to enjoy herself
by making the gun ready for use. Having
loaded it, she returned it to its case.
</p>
<p>
“I know what I’ll do,” she thought. “Uncle
Edward thinks that I cannot shoot; he thinks that
I am not good at any one single thing. But I will
show him. I’ll go out and shoot two birds on the
wing before breakfast to-morrow; whether they are
crows or whether they are doves or whether they
are game, it does not matter in the least; I’ll bring
them in and lay them at his feet, and say:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329'></a>329</span>
</p>
<p>
“Here is what your wild niece Evelyn can do;
and now you will believe that she has one accomplishment
which is not vouchsafed to other girls.”
</p>
<p>
So, having completed her task of putting the gun
in absolute readiness for its first essay in the field,
she returned the case to its corner and went up-stairs
to bed.
</p>

<p>
When Audrey and her mother found themselves
alone, Lady Frances turned at once to her daughter.
</p>
<p>
“Audrey,” she said, “I feel that I must confide
in you.”
</p>
<p>
“What about, mother?” asked Audrey.
</p>
<p>
“About Evelyn.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, mother?”
</p>
<p>
Audrey’s face looked anxious and troubled; Lady
Frances’s scarcely less so.
</p>
<p>
“The child hates me,” said Lady Frances.
“What I have done to excite such a feeling is more
than I can tell you; from the first I have done my
utmost to be kind to her.”
</p>
<p>
“It is difficult to know how best to be kind to
Evelyn,” said Audrey in a thoughtful voice.
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean, my dear?”
</p>
<p>
“I mean, mother, that she is something of a little
savage. She has never been brought up with our
ideas. Do you think, mother—I scarcely like to say
it to one whom I honor and love and respect as I
do you—but do you think you understand her?”
</p>
<p>
“No, I do not,” said Lady Frances. “I have
never understood her from the first. Your father
seems to manage her better.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331'></a>331</span>
</p>
<p>
“Ah, yes,” said Audrey; “but then, she belongs
to him.”
</p>
<p>
Lady Frances looked annoyed.
</p>
<p>
“She belongs to us all,” she remarked. “She is
your first cousin, and my niece, of course, by marriage.
Her father was a very dear fellow; how such a daughter
could have been given to him is one of those
puzzles which will never be unraveled. But now,
dear, we must descend from generalities to facts.
Something very grave and terrible has occurred.
Read did right when she told me about Evelyn’s secret
visits to Jasper at the stile. You know how from the
very first I have distrusted and disliked that woman.
You must not suppose, Audrey, that I felt no pain
when I turned the woman away after the letter
which Evelyn’s mother had written to me; but
there are times when it is wrong to yield, and I felt
that such was the case.”
</p>
<p>
“I knew, my darling mother, that you must have
acted from the best of motives,” said Audrey.
</p>
<p>
“I did, my dearest child; I did. Well, Evelyn
has managed to meet this woman, and instead of
being removed from her influence, is under it to a
remarkable and dangerous degree—for the woman,
of course, thinks herself wronged, and Evelyn agrees
with her. Now, the fact is this, Audrey: I happen
to know about that very disagreeable occurrence
which took place at Chepstow House.”
</p>
<p>
“What, mother—what?” cried Audrey. “You
speak as if you knew something special.”
</p>
<p>
“I do, Audrey.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332'></a>332</span>
</p>
<p>
“But what, mother?”
</p>
<p>
Audrey’s face turned red; her eyes shone. She
went close to her mother, knelt by her, and took
her hand.
</p>
<p>
“Who has spoken to you about it?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Henderson.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh mother! and what did she say?”
</p>
<p>
“My darling, I am afraid you will be terribly
grieved; I can scarcely tell you how upset I am.
Audrey, the strongest, the very strongest, circumstantial
evidence points to Evelyn as the guilty
person.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh mother! Evelyn! But why? Oh, surely,
surely whoever accuses poor Evelyn is mistaken!”
</p>
<p>
“I agreed with you, Audrey; I felt just as indignant
as you do when first I heard what Miss Henderson
told me; but the more I see of Evelyn the
more sure I am that she would be capable of this
action, that if the opportunity came she would do
this cruel and unjustifiable wrong, and after having
done it the unhappy child would try to conceal it.”
</p>
<p>
“But, mother darling, what motive could she
have?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, dear, let me tell you. Miss Henderson
seems to be well aware of the entire story. On
the first day when Evelyn went to school she was
asked during class to read over the reign of Edward
I. in the history of England. Evelyn, in her usual
pert way which we all know so well, declared that
she knew the reign, and while the other girls in her
form were busy with their lessons she amused herself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333'></a>333</span>
looking about her. As it was the first day, Miss
Thompson took no notice; but when the girls went
into the playground for recess she called Evelyn to
her and questioned her with regard to the history.
Evelyn’s wicked lie was immediately manifest, for
she did not know a single word about the reign. Miss
Thompson was naturally angry, and desired her to
stay in the schoolroom and learn the reign while the
other girls were at play. Evelyn was angry, but
could not resist. About six o’clock that evening Miss
Thompson came into the schoolroom, found Ruskin’s
<em>Sesame and Lilies</em>, which she had left there that
morning, and took it away with her. She was preparing
a lecture out of the book, and did not open it
at once. When she did so she perceived, to her horror,
that some pages had been torn out. You know, my
dear, what followed. You know what a strained and
unhappy condition the school is now in.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh yes, mother—yes, I know all that; the only
part that is new to me is that Evelyn was kept indoors
to learn her history.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, dear, and that supplies the motive; not to
one like you, my Audrey, but to such a perverted,
such an unhappy and ignorant child as poor Evelyn,
one who has never learnt self-control, one whose
passions are ever in the ascendency.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, poor Evelyn, poor Evelyn!” said Audrey.
“But still, mother—still——Oh, I am sure she
never did it! She has denied it, mother; whatever
she is, she is not a coward. She might have done
it in a fit of rage; but if she did she would confess.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334'></a>334</span>
Why should she wreak her anger on Miss Henderson?
Oh, mother darling, there is nothing proved
against her!”
</p>
<p>
“Wait, Audrey; I have not finished my story.
Two days passed before Miss Thompson needed to
open the history-book which Evelyn had been using;
when she did, she found, lying in the pages which
commenced the reign of Edward I., some scraps of
torn paper, all too evidently torn out of <em>Sesame and
Lilies</em>.
</p>
<p>
“Mother!”
</p>
<p>
“It is true, Audrey.”
</p>
<p>
“Who told you this?”
</p>
<p>
“Miss Henderson.”
</p>
<p>
“Does Miss Henderson believe that Evelyn is
guilty?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; and so do I.”
</p>
<p>
“Mother, mother, what will happen?”
</p>
<p>
“Who knows? But Miss Henderson is determined—and,
yes, my dear, I must say I agree with
her—she is determined to expose Evelyn; she said
she would give her a week in which to repent.”
</p>
<p>
“And that week will be up the day after to-morrow,”
said Audrey.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Audrey—yes; there is only to-morrow
left.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh mother, how can I bear it?”
</p>
<p>
“My poor child, it will be dreadful for you.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh mother, why did she come here? I could
almost hate her! And yet—no, I do not hate her—no,
I do not; I pity her.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335'></a>335</span>
</p>
<p>
“You are an angel! When I think that you, my
sweet, will be mixed up in this, and—and injured by
it, and brought to low esteem by it, oh, my dearest,
what can I say?”
</p>
<p>
Audrey was silent for a moment. She bent her
head and looked down; then she spoke.
</p>
<p>
“It is a trial,” she said, “but I am not to be pitied
as Evelyn is to be pitied. Mother darling, there is
but one thing to be done.”
</p>
<p>
“What is that, dearest?”
</p>
<p>
“To get her to repent—to get her to confess between
now and the morning after next. Oh mother!
leave her to me.”
</p>
<p>
“I will, Audrey. If any one can influence her,
you can; you are so brave, so good, so strong!”
</p>
<p>
“Nay, I have but little influence over her,” said
Audrey. “Let me think for a few moments,
mother.”
</p>
<p>
Audrey sank into a chair and sat silent. Her
sweet, pure, high-bred face was turned in profile to
her mother. Lady Frances glanced at it, and
thought over the circumstances which had brought
Evelyn into their midst.
</p>
<p>
“To think that that girl should supplant her!”
thought the mother; and her anger was so great
that she could not keep quiet. She was going out
of the room to speak to her husband, but before she
reached the door Audrey called her.
</p>
<p>
“What are you going to do, mother?”
</p>
<p>
“It is only right that I should tell you, Audrey.
An idea has come to me. Evelyn respects your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336'></a>336</span>
father; if I told him just what I have told you he
might induce her to confess.”
</p>
<p>
“No, mother,” said Audrey suddenly; “do not
let us lower her in his eyes. The strongest possible
motive for Evelyn to confess her sin will be that
father does not know; that he need never know
if she confesses. Do not tell him, please, mother; I
have got another thought.”
</p>
<p>
“What is that, my darling?”
</p>
<p>
“Do you not remember Sylvia—pretty Sylvia?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course. A dear, bright, fascinating girl!”
</p>
<p>
“Evelyn is fond of her—fonder of Sylvia than
she is of me; perhaps Sylvia could induce her to
confess.”
</p>
<p>
“It is a good thought, Audrey. I will ask Sylvia
over here to dine to-morrow evening.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, mother darling, that is too late! May I
not send a messenger for her to come in the morning?
Oh mother, if she could only come
now!”
</p>
<p>
“No dearest; it is too late to-night.”
</p>
<p>
“But Evelyn ought to see her before she goes to
school.”
</p>
<p>
“My dearest, you have both to be at school at
nine o’clock.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I don’t know what is to be done! I do feel
that I have very little influence, and Sylvia may
have much. Oh dear! oh dear!”
</p>
<p>
“Audrey, I am almost sorry I have told you;
you take it too much to heart.”
</p>
<p>
“Dear mother, you must have told me; I could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337'></a>337</span>
not have stood the shock, the surprise, unprepared.
Oh mother, think of the morning after next! Think
of our all standing up in school, and Evelyn, my
cousin, being proclaimed guilty! And yet, mother,
I ought only to think of Evelyn, and not of myself;
but I cannot help thinking of myself—I cannot—I
cannot.”
</p>
<p>
“Something must be done to help you, Audrey.
Let me think. I will write a line to Miss Henderson
and say I am detaining you both till afternoon
school. Then, dearest, you can have your talk with
Evelyn in the morning, and afterwards Sylvia can
see her, and perhaps the unhappy child may be
brought to repentance, and may speak to Miss
Henderson and confess her sin in the afternoon.
That is the best thing. Now go to bed, and do not
let the trouble worry you, my sweet; that would
indeed be the last straw.”
</p>
<p>
Audrey left the room. But during that night she
could not sleep. From side to side of her pillow she
tossed; and early in the morning, an hour or more
before her usual time of rising, she got up. She
dressed herself quickly and went in the direction of
Evelyn’s room. Her idea was to speak to Evelyn
there and then before her courage failed her. She
opened the door of her cousin’s room softly. She
expected to see Evelyn, who was very lazy as a rule,
sound asleep in bed; but, to her astonishment, the
room was empty. Where could she be?
</p>
<p>
“What can be the matter?” thought Audrey; and
in some alarm she ran down-stairs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338'></a>338</span>
</p>
<p>
The first person she saw was Evelyn, who was
making straight for her uncle’s room, intending to
go out with the well-loaded gun. Evelyn scowled
when she saw her cousin, and a look of anger swept
over her face.
</p>
<p>
“What are you doing up so early, Evelyn?” asked
Audrey.
</p>
<p>
“May I ask what are <em>you</em> doing up so early,”
retorted Evelyn.
</p>
<p>
“I got up early on purpose to talk to you.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t want to talk just now.”
</p>
<p>
“Do come with me, Evelyn—please do. Why
should you turn against me and be so disagreeable?
Oh, dear! oh dear! I am so terribly sorry for you!
Do you know that I was awake all night thinking of
you?”
</p>
<p>
“Then you were very silly,” said Evelyn, “for certainly
I was not awake thinking of you. What is
it you want to say?” she continued.
</p>
<p>
She recognized that she must give up her sport.
How more than provoking! for the next morning
she would be no longer at Wynford Castle; she
would be under the safe shelter of her beloved
Jasper’s wing.
</p>
<p>
“The morning is quite fine,” said Audrey; “do
come out and let us walk.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn looked very cross, but finally agreed, and
they went out together. Audrey wondered how
she should proceed. What could she say to influence
Evelyn? In truth, they were not the sort of
girls who would ever pull well together. Audrey had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339'></a>339</span>
been brought up in the strictest school, with the
highest sense of honor. Evelyn had been left to
grow up at her own sweet will; honorable actions
had never appealed to her. Tricks, cheating, smart
doings, clever ways, which were not the ways
of righteousness, were the ways to which she had
been accustomed. It was impossible for her to see
things with Audrey’s eyes.
</p>
<p>
“What do you want to say to me?” said Evelyn.
“Why do you look so mysterious?”
</p>
<p>
“I want to say something—something which I
must say. Evelyn, do not ask me any questions, but
do just listen. You know what is going to happen
to-morrow morning at school?”
</p>
<p>
“Lessons, I suppose,” said Evelyn.
</p>
<p>
“Please don’t be silly; you must know what I
mean.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you allude to the row about that stupid,
stupid book. What a fuss! I used to think I liked
school, but I don’t now. I am sure mistresses don’t
go on in that silly way in Tasmania, for mothery said
she loved school. Oh, the fun she had at school!
Stolen parties in the attics; suppers brought in
clandestinely; lessons shirked! Oh dear! oh dear!
she had a time of excitement. But at this school
you are all so proper! I do really think you English
girls have no spunk and no spirit.”
</p>
<p>
“But I’ll tell you what we have,” said Audrey;
and she turned and faced her cousin. “We have
honor; we have truth. We like to work straight,
not crooked; we like to do right, not wrong. Yes,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340'></a>340</span>
we do, and we are the better for it. That is what
we English girls are. Don’t abuse us, Evelyn, for
in your heart of hearts—yes, Evelyn, I repeat it—in
your heart of hearts you must long to be one
of us.”
</p>
<p>
There was something in Audrey’s tone which
startled Evelyn.
</p>
<p>
“How like Uncle Edward you look!” she said;
and perhaps she could not have paid her cousin a
higher compliment.
</p>
<p>
The look which for just a moment flitted across
the queer little face of the Tasmanian girl upset
Audrey. She struggled to retain her composure, but
the next moment burst into tears.
</p>
<p>
“Oh dear!” said Evelyn, who hated people who
cried, “what is the matter?”
</p>
<p>
“You are the matter. Oh, why—<em>why</em> did you
do it?”
</p>
<p>
“I do what?” said Evelyn, a little startled, and
turning very pale.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! you know you did it, and—and—— There
is Sylvia Leeson coming across the grass. Do let
Sylvia speak to you. Oh, you know—you know
you did it!”
</p>
<p>
“What is the matter?” said Sylvia, running up,
panting and breathless. “I have been asked to
breakfast here. Such fun! I slipped off without
father knowing. But are not you two going to
school? Why was I asked? Audrey, what are you
crying about?”
</p>
<p>
“About Evelyn. I am awfully unhappy——”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341'></a>341</span>
</p>
<p>
“Have you told, Evelyn?” asked Sylvia breathlessly.
</p>
<p>
“No,” said Evelyn; “and if you do, Sylvia——”
</p>
<p>
“Sylvia, do you know about this?” cried Audrey.
</p>
<p>
“About what?” asked Sylvia.
</p>
<p>
“About the book which got injured at Miss Henderson’s
school.”
</p>
<p>
Sylvia glanced at Evelyn; then her face flushed,
her eyes brightened, and she said emphatically:
</p>
<p>
“I know; and dear little Evelyn will tell you herself.—Won’t
you, darling—won’t you?”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn looked from one to the other.
</p>
<p>
“You are enough, both of you, to drive me mad,”
she said. “Do you think for a single moment that
I am going to speak against myself? I hate you,
Sylvia, as much as I ever loved you.”
</p>
<p>
Before either girl could prevent her she slipped
away, and flying round the shrubberies, was lost to
view.
</p>
<p>
“Then she did do it?” said Audrey. “She told
you?”
</p>
<p>
Sylvia shut her lips.
</p>
<p>
“I must not say any more,” she answered.
</p>
<p>
“But, Sylvia, it is no secret. Miss Henderson
knows; there is circumstantial evidence. Mother
told me last night. Evelyn will be exposed before
the whole school.”
</p>
<p>
Now Jasper, for wise reasons, had said nothing to
Sylvia of Evelyn’s proposed flight to The Priory, and
consequently she was unaware that the naughty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342'></a>342</span>
girl had no intention of exposing herself to public
disgrace.
</p>
<p>
“She must be brought to confess,” continued
Audrey, “and you must find her and talk to her.
You must show her how hopeless and helpless she
is. Show her that if she tells, the disgrace will
not be quite so awful. Oh, do please get her to
tell!”
</p>
<p>
“I can but try,” said Sylvia; “only, somehow,”
she added, “I have not yet quite fathomed Evelyn.”
</p>
<p>
“But I thought she was fond of you?”
</p>
<p>
“You see what she said. She did confide something
to me, only I must not tell you any more;
and she is angry with me because she thinks I have
not respected her confidence. Oh, what is to be
done? Yes, I will go and have a talk with her.
Go in, please, Audrey; you look dead tired.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! as if anything mattered,” said Audrey.
“I could almost wish that I were dead; the disgrace
is past enduring.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343'></a>343</span><a name='chXXVII' id='chXXVII'></a>CHAPTER XXVII.—THE STRANGE VISITOR IN THE BACK BEDROOM.</h2>
<p>
In vain Sylvia pleaded and argued. She brought
all her persuasions to bear; she brought all her
natural sweetness to the fore. She tried love, with
which she was so largely endowed; she tried tact,
which had been given to her in full measure; she
tried the gentle touch of scorn and sarcasm; finally
she tried anger, but for all she said and did she might
as well have held her peace. Evelyn put on that
stubbornness with which she could encase herself as
in armor; nowhere could Sylvia find a crack or a
crevice through which her words might pierce the
obdurate and naughty little heart. What was to
be done? At last she gave up in despair. Audrey
met her outside Evelyn’s room. Sylvia shook her
head.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t question me,” she said. “I am very unhappy.
I pity you from my heart. I can say
nothing; I am bound in honor to say nothing.
Poor Evelyn will reap her own punishment.”
</p>
<p>
“If,” said Audrey, “you have failed I give up all
hope.”
</p>
<p>
After lunch Evelyn and Audrey went back to
school. There were a good many classes to be held
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344'></a>344</span>
that afternoon—one for deportment, another for
dancing, another for recitation. Evelyn could recite
extremely well when she chose. She looked almost
pretty when she recited some of the spirited ballads
of her native land for the benefit of the school. Her
eyes glowed, darkened, and deepened; the pallor of
her face was transformed and beautified by a faint
blush. There was a heart somewhere within her;
as Audrey watched her she was obliged to acknowledge
that fact.
</p>
<p>
“She is thinking of her dead mother now,”
thought the girl. “Oh, if only that mother had
been different we should not be placed in our present
terrible position!”
</p>
<p>
It was the custom of the school for the girls on
recitation afternoons to do their pieces in the great
hall. Miss Henderson, Miss Lucy, and a few visitors
generally came to listen to the recitations. Miss
Thompson was the recitation mistress, and right well
did she perform her task. If a girl had any dramatic
power, if a girl had any talent for seeing behind
the story and behind the dream of the poet, Miss
Thompson was the one to bring that gift to the surface.
Evelyn, who was a dramatist by nature, became
like wax in her hands; the way in which she
recited that afternoon brought a feeling of astonishment
to those who listened to her.
</p>
<p>
“What remarkable little girl is that?” said a lady
of the neighboring town to Miss Henderson.
</p>
<p>
“She is a Tasmanian and Squire Edward Wynford’s
niece,” replied Miss Henderson; but it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345'></a>345</span>
evident that she was not to be drawn out on the
subject, nor would she allow herself to express any
approbation of Evelyn’s really remarkable powers.
</p>
<p>
Audrey’s piece, compared with Evelyn’s, was tame
and wanting in spirit. It was well rendered, it is
true, but the ring of passion was absent.
</p>
<p>
“Really,” said the same lady again, “I doubt
whether recitations such as Miss Evelyn Wynford
has given are good for the school; surely girls
ought not to have their minds overexcited with such
things!”
</p>
<p>
Miss Henderson was again silent.
</p>
<p>
The time passed by, and the close of the day arrived.
Just as the girls were putting on their cloaks
and hats preparatory to going home, and some were
collecting round and praising Evelyn for her remarkable
performance of the afternoon, Miss Henderson
appeared on the scene. She touched the little girl
on the arm.
</p>
<p>
“One moment,” she said.
</p>
<p>
“What do you want?” said Evelyn, backing.
</p>
<p>
“To speak to you, my dear.”
</p>
<p>
Audrey gave Evelyn a beseeching look. Perhaps
if Audrey had refrained from looking at that moment,
Evelyn, excited by her triumph, touched by
the plaudits of her companions, might have done
what she was expected to do, and what immediately
followed need not have taken place. But Evelyn
hated Audrey, and if for no other reason but to
annoy her she would stand by her guns.
</p>
<p>
Miss Henderson took her hand, and entered a room
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346'></a>346</span>
adjoining the cloakroom. She closed the door, and
said:
</p>
<p>
“The week is nearly up. You know what will
happen to-morrow?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Evelyn, lowering her eyes.
</p>
<p>
“You will be present?”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn was silent.
</p>
<p>
“I shall see that you are. You must realize already
what a pitiable figure you will be, how deep
and lasting will be your disgrace. You have just
tasted the sweets of success; why should you undergo
that which will be said of you to-morrow, that which
no English girl can ever forgive? It will not be forgotten
in the school that owing to you much enjoyment
has been cut short, that owing to you a cloud
has rested on the entire place for several days—prizes
forgone, liberty curtailed, amusements debarred;
and, before and above all these things, the fearful
stigma of disgrace resting on every girl at Chepstow
House. But even now, Evelyn, there is time; even
now, by a full confession, much can be mitigated.
You know, my dear, how strong is the case against
you. To-morrow morning both Miss Thompson and
I proclaim before the entire school what has occurred.
You are, in short, as a prisoner at the bar. The
school will be the judges; they will declare whether
you are innocent or guilty.”
</p>
<p>
“Let me go,” said Evelyn. “Why do you torture
me? I said I did not do it, and I mean to stick to
what I said. Let me go.”
</p>
<p>
“Unhappy child! I shall not be able to retain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347'></a>347</span>
you in the school after to-morrow morning. But go
now—go. God help you!”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn walked across the hall. Her school companions
were still standing about; many wondered
why her face was so pale, and asked one another
what Miss Henderson had to say in especial to the
little girl.
</p>
<p>
“It cannot be,” said Sophie, “that she did it.
Why, of course she did not do it; she would have
no motive.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t let us talk about it,” said her companion.
“For my part I rather like Evelyn—there is something
so quaint and out-of-the-common about her—only
I wish she would not look so angry sometimes.”
</p>
<p>
“But how splendidly she recited that song of the
ranch!” said Sophie. “I could see the whole
picture. We must not expect her to be quite like
ourselves; before she came here she was only a wild
little savage.”
</p>
<p>
The governess-cart had come for the two girls.
They drove home in silence. Audrey was thinking
of the misery of the following morning. Evelyn was
planning her escape. She meant to go before dinner.
She had asked Jasper to meet her at seven o’clock
precisely. She had thought everything out, and
that seemed to be the best hour; the family would
be in their different rooms dressing. Evelyn would
make an excuse to send Read away—indeed, she
seldom now required her services, preferring to dress
alone. Read would be busy with her mistress and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348'></a>348</span>
her own young lady, and Evelyn would thus be able
to slip away without her prying eyes observing it.
</p>
<p>
Tea was ready for the girls when they got home.
They took it almost without speaking. Evelyn
avoided looking at Audrey. Audrey felt that it
was now absolutely hopeless to say a word to
Evelyn.
</p>
<p>
“I should just like to bid Uncle Edward good-by,”
thought the child. “Perhaps I may never come
back again. I do not suppose Aunt Frances will ever
allow me to live at the Castle again. I should like
to kiss Uncle Edward; he is the one person in this
house whom I love.”
</p>
<p>
She hesitated between her desire and her frantic
wish to be out of reach of danger as soon as possible,
but in the end the thought that her uncle might
notice something different from usual about her made
her afraid of making the attempt. She went up to
her room.
</p>
<p>
“It is not necessary to dress yet,” said Audrey,
who was going slowly in the direction of the pretty
schoolroom.
</p>
<p>
“No; but I have a slight headache,” said Evelyn.
“I will lie down for a few minutes before dinner.
And, oh! please, Audrey, tell Read I do not want
her to come and dress me this evening. I shall put
on my white frock, and I know how to fasten it
myself.”
</p>
<p>
“All right; I will tell her,” replied Audrey.
</p>
<p>
She did not say any more, but went on her way.
Evelyn entered her room. There she packed a few
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349'></a>349</span>
things in a bag; she was not going to take much.
In the bottom of the bag she placed for security the
two little rolls of gold. These she covered over with
a stout piece of brown paper; over the brown paper
she laid the treasures she most valued. It did not
occur to her to take any of the clothes which her
Aunt Frances had bought for her.
</p>
<p>
“I do not need them,” she said to herself. “I
shall have my own dear old things to wear again.
Jasper took my trunks, and they are waiting for me
at The Priory. How happy I shall be in a few
minutes! I shall have forgotten the awful misery
of my life at Castle Wynford. I shall have forgotten
that horrid scene which is to take place to-morrow
morning. I shall be the old Evelyn again. How
astonished Sylvia will be! Whatever Sylvia is, she
is true to Jasper; and she will be true to me, and
she will not betray me.”
</p>
<p>
The time flew on; soon it was a quarter to seven.
Evelyn could see the minute and hour hand of the
pretty clock on her mantelpiece. The time seemed
to go on leaden wings. She did not dare to stir until
a few minutes after the dressing-gong had sounded;
then she knew she should find the coast clear. At
last seven silvery chimes sounded from the little
clock, and a minute later the great gong in the central
hall pealed through the house. There was the gentle
rustle of ladies’ silk dresses as they went to their
rooms to dress—for a few visitors had arrived at the
Castle that day. Evelyn knew this, and had made
her plans accordingly. The family had a good deal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350'></a>350</span>
to think of; Read would be specially busy. She
went to the table where she had put her little bag,
caught it up, took a thick shawl on her arm, and
prepared to rush down-stairs. She opened the door
of her room and peeped out. All was stillness in the
corridor. All was stillness in the hall below. She
hoped that she could reach the side entrance and get
away into the shrubberies without any one seeing
her. Cautiously and swiftly she descended the
stairs. The stairs were made of white marble, and
of course there was no sound. She crossed the big
hall and went down by a side corridor. Once she
looked back, having a horrible suspicion that some
one was watching her. There was no one in sight.
She opened the side door, and the next instant had
shut it behind her. She gave a gasp of pleasure.
She was free; the horrid house would know her no
more.
</p>
<p>
“Not until I go back as mistress and pay them all
out,” thought the angry little girl. “Never again
will I live at Castle Wynford until I am mistress
here.”
</p>
<p>
Then she put wings to her feet and began to run.
But, alas for Evelyn! the best-laid plans are sometimes
upset, and at the moment of greatest security
comes the sudden fall. For she had not gone a
dozen yards before a hand was laid on her shoulder,
and turning round and trying to extricate herself,
she saw her Aunt Frances. Lady Frances, who she
supposed was safe in her room was standing by her
side.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351'></a>351</span>
</p>
<p>
“Evelyn,” she said, “what are you doing?”
</p>
<p>
“Nothing,” said Evelyn, trying to wriggle out of
her aunt’s grasp.
</p>
<p>
“Then come back to the house with me.”
</p>
<p>
She took the little girl’s hand, and they re-entered
the house side by side.
</p>
<p>
“You were running away,” said Lady Frances,
“but I do not permit that. We will not argue the
point; come up-stairs.”
</p>
<p>
She took Evelyn up to her room. There she
opened the door and pushed her in.
</p>
<p>
“Doubtless you can do without dinner as you intended
to run away,” said Lady Frances. “I will
speak to you afterwards; for the present you stay
in your room.” She locked the door and put the
key into her pocket.
</p>
<p>
The angry child was locked in. To say that
Evelyn was wild with passion, despair, and rage is
but lightly to express the situation. For a time she
was almost speechless; then she looked round her
prison. Were there any means of escape? Oh!
she would not stand it; she would burst open the
door. Alas, alas for her puny strength! the door
was of solid oak, firmly fastened, securely locked;
it would defy the efforts of twenty little girls of
Evelyn’s size and age. The window—she would escape
by the window! She rushed to it, opened it,
and looked out. Evelyn’s room was, it is true, on
the first floor, but the drop to the ground beneath
seemed too much for her. She shuddered as she
looked below.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_352'></a>352</span>
</p>
<p>
“If I were on the ranch, twenty Aunt Franceses
would not keep me,” she thought; and then she ran
into her sitting-room.
</p>
<p>
Of late she had scarcely ever used her sitting-room,
but now she remembered it. The windows here
were French; they looked on the flower-garden.
To drop down here would not perhaps be so difficult;
the ground at least would be soft. Evelyn
wondered if she might venture; but she had once
seen, long ago in Tasmania, a black woman try to
escape. She had heard the thud of the woman’s
body as it alighted on the ground, and the shriek
which followed. This woman had been found and
brought back to the house, and had suffered for weeks
from a badly-broken leg. Evelyn now remembered
that thud, and that broken leg, and the shriek of the
victim. It would be worse than folly to injure herself.
But, oh, was it not maddening? Jasper would
be waiting for her—Jasper with her big heart and
her great black eyes and her affectionate manner;
and the little white bed would be made, and the delicious
chocolate in preparation; and the fun and
the delightful escapade and the daring adventure
must all be at an end. But they should not—no, no,
they should not!
</p>
<p>
“What a fool I am!” thought Evelyn. “Why
should I not make a rope and descend in that way?
Aunt Frances has locked me in, but she does not
know how daring is the nature of Evelyn Wynford.
I inherit it from my darling mothery; I will not
allow myself to be defeated.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_353'></a>353</span>
</p>
<p>
Her courage and her spirits revived when she
thought of the rope. She must wait, however, at
least until half-past seven. The great gong sounded
once more. Evelyn rushed to her door, and heard
the rustle of the silken dresses of the ladies as they
descended. She had her eye at the keyhole, and
fancied that she detected the hated form of her aunt
robed in ruby velvet. A slim young figure in white
also softly descended.
</p>
<p>
“My cousin Audrey,” thought the girl. “Oh
dear! oh dear! and they leave me here, locked up
like a rat in a trap. They leave me here, and I am
out of everything. Oh, I cannot, will not stand
it!”
</p>
<p>
She ran to her bed, tore off the sheets, took a
pair of scissors, and cut them into strips. She had
all the ways and quick knowledge of a girl from the
wilds. She knew how to make a knot which would
hold. Soon her rope was ready. It was quite strong
enough to bear her light weight. She fastened it
to a heavy article of furniture just inside the French
windows of her sitting-room, and then dropping her
little bag to the ground below, she herself swiftly
descended.
</p>
<p>
“Free! free!” she murmured. “Free in spite of
her! She will see how I have gone. Oh, won’t she
rage? What fun! It is almost worth the misery
of the last half-hour to have escaped as I have done.”
</p>
<p>
There was no one now to watch the little culprit
as she stole across the grass. She ran up to the stile
where Jasper was still waiting for her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_354'></a>354</span>
</p>
<p>
“My darling,” said Jasper, “how late you are!
I was just going back; I had given you up.”
</p>
<p>
“Kiss me, Jasper,” said Evelyn. “Hug me and
love me and carry me a bit of the way in your strong
arms; and, oh! be quick—be very quick—for we
must hide, you and I, where no one can ever, ever
find us. Oh Jasper, Jasper, I have had such a
time!”
</p>
<p>
It was not Jasper’s way to say much in moments
of emergency. She took Evelyn up, wrapped her
warm fur cloak well round the little girl, and proceeded
as quickly as she could in the direction of
The Priory. Evelyn laid her head on her faithful
nurse’s shoulder, and a ray of warmth and comfort
visited her miserable little soul.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I am lost but for you!” she murmured once
or twice. “How I hate England! How I hate Aunt
Frances! How I hate the horrid, horrid school, and
even Audrey! But I love you, darling, darling Jasper,
and I am happy once more.”
</p>
<p>
“You are not lost with me, my little white Eve,”
said Jasper. “You are safe with me; and I tell you
what it is, my sweet, you and I will part no more.”
</p>
<p>
“We never, never will,” said the little girl with
fervor; and she clasped Jasper still more tightly
round the neck.
</p>
<p>
But notwithstanding all Jasper’s love and good-will,
the little figure began to grow heavy, and the
way seemed twice as long as usual; and when Evelyn
begged and implored of her nurse to hurry, hurry,
hurry, poor Jasper’s heart began to beat in great
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_355'></a>355</span>
thumps, and finally she paused, and said with panting
breath:
</p>
<p>
“I must drop you to the ground, my dearie, and
you must run beside me, for I have lost my breath,
pet, and I cannot carry you any farther.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, how selfish I am!” said Evelyn at once.
“Yes, of course I will run, Jasper. I can walk quite
well now. I have got over my first fright. The
great thing of all is to hurry. And you are certain,
certain sure they will not look for me at The
Priory?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, now, darling, how could they? Nobody
but Sylvia knows that I live at The Priory, and
why should they think that you had gone there?
No; it is the police they will question, and the
village they will go to, and the railway maybe.
But it is fun to think of the fine chase we are giving
them, and all to no purpose.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn laughed, and the two, holding each other’s
hands, continued on their way. By and by they
reached the back entrance to The Priory. Jasper
had left the gate a little ajar. Pilot came up to show
attentions; he began to growl at Evelyn, but Jasper
laid her hand on his big forehead.
</p>
<p>
“A friend, good dog! A little friend, Pilot,”
was Jasper’s remark; and then Pilot wagged his
tail and allowed his friend Jasper—to whom he was
much attached, as she furnished him with unlimited
chicken-bones—to go to the house. Two or three
minutes later Evelyn found herself established in
Jasper’s snug, pretty little bedroom. There the fire
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_356'></a>356</span>
blazed; supper was in course of preparation. Evelyn
flung herself down on a chair and panted slightly.
</p>
<p>
“So this is where you live?” she said.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, my darling, this is where I live.”
</p>
<p>
“And where is Sylvia?” asked Evelyn.
</p>
<p>
“She is having supper with her father at the
present moment.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! I should like to see her. How excited and
astonished she will be! She won’t tell—you are
sure of that, Jasper?”
</p>
<p>
“Tell! Sylvia tell!” said Jasper. “Not quite,
my dearie.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I should like to see her.”
</p>
<p>
“She’ll be here presently.”
</p>
<p>
“You have not told that I was coming?”
</p>
<p>
“No, darling; I thought it best not.”
</p>
<p>
“That is famous, Jasper; and do you know, I
am quite hungry, so you might get something to
eat without delay.”
</p>
<p>
“You did not by any chance forget the money?”
said Jasper, looking anxiously at Evelyn.
</p>
<p>
“Oh no; it is in my little black bag; you had
better take it while you think of it. It is in two
rolls; Uncle Edward gave it to me. It is all gold—gold
sovereigns; and there are twenty of them.”
</p>
<p>
“Are not you a darling, a duck, and all the rest!”
said Jasper, much relieved at this information. “I
would not worry you for the money, darling,” she
continued as she bustled about and set the milk on
to boil for Evelyn’s favorite beverage, “but that my
own funds are getting seriously low. You never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_357'></a>357</span>
knew such a state as we live in here. But we have
fun, darling; and we shall have all the more fun
now that you have come.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn leant back in her chair without replying.
She had lived through a good deal that day, and
she was tired and glad to rest. She felt secure.
She was hungry, too; and it was nice to be petted
by Jasper. She watched the preparations for the
chocolate, and when it was made she sipped it eagerly,
and munched a sponge-cake, and tried to believe
that she was the happiest little girl in the world.
But, oh! what ailed her? How was it that she
could not quite forget the horrid days at the Castle,
and the dreadful days at school, and Audrey’s face,
and Lady Frances’s manner, and—last but not least—dear,
sweet, kind Uncle Edward?
</p>
<p>
“And I never proved to him that I could shoot
a bird on the wing,” she thought. “What a pity—what
a sad pity! He will find the gun loaded, and
how astonished he will be! And he will never,
never know that it was his Evelyn loaded it and
left it ready. Oh dear! I am sorry that I am not
likely to see Uncle Edward for a long time again.
I am sorry that Uncle Edward will be angry; I do
not mind about any one else, but I am sorry about
him.”
</p>
<p>
Just then there came the sound of a high-pitched
and sweet voice in the kitchen outside.
</p>
<p>
“There is Sylvia,” said Jasper. “I am going to
tell her now, and to bring her in.”
</p>
<p>
She went into the outside kitchen. Sylvia, in her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_358'></a>358</span>
shabbiest dress, with a pinched, cold look on her
face, was standing by the embers of the fire.
</p>
<p>
“Oh Jasper,” she said eagerly, “I do not know
what to make of my father to-night! He has evidently
had bad news by the post to-day—something
about his last investments. I never saw him so
low or so irritable, and he was quite cross about the
nice little hash you made for his supper. He says
that he will cut down the fuel-supply, and that I am
not to have big fires for cooking; and, worst of all,
Jasper, he threatens to come into the kitchen to see
for himself how I manage. Do you know, I feel
quite frightened to-night. He is very strange in
his manner, and suspicious; and he looks so cold,
too. No fire will he allow in the sitting-room. He
gets worse and worse.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, darling,” said Jasper as cheerfully as she
could, “this is an old story, is it not? He did eat
his hash, when all is said and done.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; but I don’t like his manner. And you
know he discovered about the boxes in the box-room.”
</p>
<p>
“That is over and done with too,” said Jasper.
“He cannot say much about that; he can only puzzle
and wonder, but it would take him a long time to
find out the truth.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t like his way,” repeated Sylvia.
</p>
<p>
“And perhaps you don’t like my way either,
Sylvia,” said a strange voice; and Sylvia uttered a
scream, for Evelyn stood before her.
</p>
<p>
“Evelyn!” cried the girl. “Where have you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_359'></a>359</span>
come from? Oh, what is the matter? Oh, I do declare
my head is going round!”
</p>
<p>
She clasped her hands to her forehead in absolute
bewilderment. Jasper went and locked the kitchen
door.
</p>
<p>
“Now we are safe,” she said; “and you two had
best go into the bedroom. Yes, you had, for when
he comes along it is the wisest plan for him to find
the kitchen locked and the place in darkness. He
will never think of my bedroom; and, indeed, when
the curtains are drawn and the shutters shut you
cannot get a blink of light from the outside, however
hard you try.”
</p>
<p>
“Come, Sylvia,” said Evelyn. She took Sylvia’s
hand and dragged her into the bedroom.
</p>
<p>
“But why have you come, Evelyn? Why is it?”
said poor Sylvia, in great distress and alarm.
</p>
<p>
“You will have to welcome me whether you like
it or not,” said Evelyn; “and what is more, you
will have to be true to me. I came here because
I have run away—run away from the school and
the fuss and the disgrace of to-morrow—run away
from horrid Aunt Frances and from the horrid
Castle; and I have come here to dear old Jasper;
and I have brought my own money, so you need not
be at any expense. And if you tell you will—— But,
oh, Sylvia, you will not tell?”
</p>
<p>
“But this is terrible!” said Sylvia. “I don’t
understand—I cannot understand.”
</p>
<p>
“Sit down, Miss Sylvia, dearie,” said Jasper, “and
I will try to explain.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_360'></a>360</span>
</p>
<p>
Sylvia sank down on the side of the little white
bed.
</p>
<p>
“Now I know why you were getting this ready,”
she said. “You would not explain to me, and I
thought perhaps it was for me. Oh dear! oh dear!”
</p>
<p>
“I longed to tell you, but I dared not,” said Jasper.
“Would I let my sweet little lady die or be
disgraced? That is not in me. She will hide here
with me for a bit, and afterwards—it will come all
right afterwards, my dear Miss Sylvia. Why,
there, darlings! I love you both. And see what I
have been planning. I mean to go up-stairs to-night
and sleep in your room, Miss Sylvia. Yes, darling;
and you and Miss Evelyn can sleep together here.
The supper is all ready, and I have had as much as
I want. I mean to go quickly; and then if your
father comes along and rattles at the kitchen door
he’ll get no answer, and if he peers through the
keyhole, the place will be black as night. Then,
being made up of suspicions, poor man, he’ll tramp
up-stairs and he’ll thunder at your door; but it will
be locked, and after a time I’ll answer him in your
voice from the heart of the big bed, and all his suspicions
will melt away like snow when the sun
shines on it. That is all, Miss Sylvia; and I mean
to do it, and at once, too; for if we were so careful
and chary and anxious before, we must be twice
as careful and twice as chary now that I have got
the precious little Eve to look after.”
</p>
<p>
Jasper’s plan was carried out to the letter.
Sylvia did not like it, but at the same time she did
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_361'></a>361</span>
not know how to oppose it; and when Evelyn put
her arms round her neck and was soft and gentle—she
who was so hard with most, and so difficult to
manage—and when she pleaded with tears in her
big brown eyes and a pathetic look on her white
face, Sylvia yielded for the present. Whatever
happened, she would not betray her.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_362'></a>362</span><a name='chXXVIII' id='chXXVIII'></a>CHAPTER XXVIII.—THE ROOM WITH THE LIGHT THAT FLICKERED.</h2>
<p>
Now, all might have gone well for the little conspirators
but for Evelyn herself. But when the girls,
tired with talking, tired with the spirit of adventure,
had lain down—Sylvia in Jasper’s bed, and Evelyn
in the new little white couch which had been got so
lovingly ready for her—Sylvia, tired out, soon fell
asleep; but Evelyn could not rest. She was pleased,
excited, relieved, but at the same time she had a
curious sense of disappointment about her. Her
heart beat fast; she wondered what was happening.
It seemed to her that in this tiny room at the back
of the kitchen she was in a sort of prison. The
sense of being in prison was anything but pleasant
to this child of a free country and of an untrained
mother. She slipped softly out of bed, and going to
the window, unbarred the heavy shutters and looked
out.
</p>
<p>
There was a moon in the sky, and the garden
stood in streaks of bright light, and of dense shadow
where the thick yew-hedge shut away the cold rays
of the moon. Evelyn’s white little face was pressed
against the pane. Pilot stalked up and down outside,
now and then baying to the moon, now and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_363'></a>363</span>
then uttering a suspicious bark, but he never glanced
in the direction of the window out of which Evelyn
looked. To the right of the window lay the hens’
run and hen-house which have already been mentioned
in these pages. Evelyn knew nothing about
them, however; she thought the view ugly and uninteresting.
She disliked the thick yew-hedge and
the gnarled old yew-tree, and grumbling under her
breath, she turned from the window, having quite
forgotten to close the shutters. She got into bed
now and fell asleep, little knowing what mischief
she had done.
</p>
<p>
For it was on that very same night that Mr. Leeson
determined, not to bury his bags of gold, but to dig
them up. He was in a weak and trembling condition,
and what he considered the most terrible misfortune
had overpowered him, for the large sums
which he had lately invested in the Kilcolman Gold-mines
had been irretrievably lost; the gold-mines
were nothing more nor less than a huge fraud, and
all the shareholders had lost their money. The
daily papers were full of the fraudulent scheme, and
indignation was rife against the promoters of the
company. But little cared Mr. Leeson for that; one
fact alone concerned him. He, who grudged a
penny to give his only child warmth and comfort,
had by one fell blow lost thousands of pounds. He
was almost like a man bereft of his senses. When
Sylvia had left him that evening he had stood for
some time in the cold and desolate parlor; then he
sat down and began to think. His money was invested
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_364'></a>364</span>
in more than one apparently promising speculation.
He meant to call it all in—to collect it
all and leave the country. He would not trust another
sovereign in any bank in the kingdom; he
would guard his own money; above all things, he
would guard his precious savings. He had saved
during his residence at The Priory something over
twelve hundred pounds. This money, which really
represented income, not capital, had been taken from
what ought to have been spent on the necessaries of
life. More and more had he saved, until a penny
saved was more valuable in his eyes than any virtue
under the sun; and as he saved and added sovereign
to sovereign, he buried his money in canvas bags
in the garden. But the time had come now to dig
up his gold and fly. There were three trunks in the
box-room; he would divide the money between the
three. They were strong, covered with cow-hide,
old-fashioned, safe to endure even such a weight as
was to be put into them. He had made all his plans.
He meant to take Sylvia, leave The Priory, and go.
What further savings he could effect in a foreign
land he knew not; he only wanted to be up and
doing. This night, just when the moon set, would
be the very time for his purpose. He was anxious—very
anxious—about those fresh trunks which had
been put into the attic; there was something also
about Sylvia which aroused his suspicions. He felt
certain that she was not quite so open with him as
formerly. Those suppers were too good, too delicate,
too tasty to be eaten without suspicion. At the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_365'></a>365</span>
best she was burning too much fuel. He would go
round to the kitchen this very night and see for
himself that the fire was out—dead out. Why
should Sylvia warm herself by the kitchen fire while
he shivered fireless and almost candleless in the
desolate parlor? Soon after ten o’clock, therefore,
he started on his rounds. He went through room
after room, looking into each; he had never been
so restless. He felt that a great and terrible task lay
before him, and so bewildered was his mind, so
much was his balance shaken, that he thought
more of the twelve hundred pounds which he had
saved than of the thousands which he had lost by
foolish investment. The desolate rooms in the old
Priory were all as they had ever been—scarcely any
furniture in some, no furniture at all in others; they
were bare and bleak and ugly. He went to the
kitchen; the door was locked. He shook it and
called aloud; there was no answer.
</p>
<p>
“The child has gone to bed,” he said to himself.
“That is well.”
</p>
<p>
He stooped down and tried to look through the
keyhole; only darkness met his gaze. He turned
and shambled up-stairs. He turned the handle of
Sylvia’s door. How wise had been Jasper when she
had guessed that the master of the house would do
just what he did do!
</p>
<p>
“Sylvia!” he called aloud—“Sylvia!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, father,” said a voice which seemed to be
quite the voice of his daughter.
</p>
<p>
“Are you in bed?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_366'></a>366</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Do you want me?”
</p>
<p>
“No; stay where you are. Good night.”
</p>
<p>
“Good night,” answered the pretended Sylvia.
</p>
<p>
But Mr. Leeson, as he went down-stairs, did not
hear the stifled laughter which was smothered in
the pillows. He waited until the moon was on the
wane, and then, armed with the necessary implements,
went into the garden. He would certainly
remove half the bags that night; the remainder
might wait until to-morrow.
</p>
<p>
He reached the garden; he arrived at the spot
where his treasure was buried, and then he stood still
for a moment, and looked around him. Everything
seemed all right—silent as the grave—still as death.
It was a windless night; the moon would very soon
set and there would be darkness. He wanted darkness
for his purpose. Pilot came shuffling up.
</p>
<p>
“Good dog! guard—guard. Good dog!” said his
master.
</p>
<p>
Pilot had been trained to know what this meant,
and he went immediately and stood within a foot or
two of the main entrance. Mr. Leeson did not know
that a gate at the back entrance was no longer
firmly secured and chained, as he imagined it to be.
He thought himself safe, and began to work.
</p>
<p>
He had dug up six of the bags, and there were
six more yet to be unearthed, when, suddenly raising
his head, he saw a light in a window on the ground
floor. It was a very faint light, and seemed to come
and go.
</p>
<p>
He was much puzzled. His heart beat strangely;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_367'></a>367</span>
suspicion visited him. Had any one seen him? If
so he was lost. He dared not wait another moment;
he took two of the bags of gold and dragged them as
best he could into the house. He went out again to
fetch another two, and yet another two. He put
the six canvas bags in the empty hall, and then returning
to the garden, he pressed down the earth
and covered it with gravel, and tried to make it
look as if no one had been there—as if no one had
disturbed it. But he was trembling all over, and as
he did so he looked again at the flickering, broken
light which came dimly, like something gray and uncertain,
from within the room.
</p>
<p>
He went on tiptoe softly, very softly, up to the window
and peered in. He could not see much—nothing,
in fact, except one thing. The room had a fire. That
was enough for him.
</p>
<p>
Furious anger shook the man to his depths. He
hurried into the house.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_368'></a>368</span><a name='chXXIX' id='chXXIX'></a>CHAPTER XXIX.—WHAT COULD IT MEAN?</h2>
<p>
Anger gave Mr. Leeson a false strength. He put
the canvas bags of gold into a large cupboard in the
parlor; he locked the door and put the key into his
pocket. Then he went gingerly and on tiptoe to
another cupboard, and took down out of the midst
of an array of dirty empty bottles one which contained
a very little brandy. He kept this brandy
here so that no one should guess at its existence.
He poured himself out about a thimbleful of the potent
spirit and drank it off. He then returned the
bottle to its place, and fumbling in a lower shelf, collected
some implements together. With these he
went out into the open air.
</p>
<p>
He now approached the window where the light
shone—the faint, dim light which flickered against the
blind and seemed almost to go out, and then shone
once more. Slowly and dexterously he cut, with a
diamond which he had brought for the purpose, a
square of glass out of the lower pane. He put the
glass on the ground, and slipping in his hand, pushed
back the bolt. All his movements were quiet. He
said “Ah!” once or twice under his breath. When
he had gently and very softly lifted the sash, he took
a handkerchief from his pocket and wiped away
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_369'></a>369</span>
some drops which stood on his forehead. Then he
said “Ah!” once more, and slipped softly, deftly,
and quietly into the room. He had made no noise
whatsoever. The young sleepers never moved.
He stood in the fire-lit, and in his opinion lavishly
furnished, room. Here was a small white bed and
an occupant; here a larger bed and another occupant.
He crept on tiptoe towards the two beds. He bent
down over the little occupant of the smaller bed.
</p>
<p>
A girl—a stranger! A girl with long, fair hair,
and light lashes lying on a white cheek. A curious-looking
girl! She moaned once or twice in her
sleep. He did not want to awaken her.
</p>
<p>
He looked towards the other bed, in which lay
Sylvia, pretty, debonair, rosy in her happy, warm
slumber. She had flung one arm outside the counterpane.
Her lips parted; she uttered the words:
</p>
<p>
“Darling father! Poor, poor father!”
</p>
<p>
The man who listened started back as though
something had struck him.
</p>
<p>
Sylvia in that bed—Sylvia who had spoken to him
not two hours ago up-stairs? What did it mean?
What could it mean? And who was this stranger?
And what did the fire mean, and all the furniture?
A carpet on the floor, too! A carpet on his floor—his!
And a fire which he had never warranted in
his grate, and beds which he had never ordered in
his room! Oh! was it not enough to strike a man
mad with fury? And yet again! what was this?
A table and the remains of supper! Good living,
warmth, luxuries, under the roof of the man who was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_370'></a>370</span>
fireless and cold and, as he himself fondly and foolishly
believed, a beggar!
</p>
<p>
He stood absolutely dumb. He would not awaken
the sleepers. A strange sensation visited him. He
was determined not to give way to his passions; he
was determined, before he said a word to Sylvia, to
regain his self-control.
</p>
<p>
“Once I said bitter things to her mother; I will
not err in that direction any more,” he said to himself.
“And in her sleep she called me ‘Father’
and ‘Poor father.’ But all the same I shall cast
her away. She is no longer my Sylvia. I disown
her; I disinherit her. She goes out into the cold.
She is ruining her father. She has deceived me; she
shall never be anything to me again. Paw! how I
hate her!”
</p>
<p>
He went to the window, got out just as he had got
in, drew down the sash, and stepped softly across
the dark lawn.
</p>
<p>
He was very cold now, and he felt faint; the
effect of the tiny supply of brandy which he had
administered to himself had worn off. He went
into his desolate parlor. How cold it was! He
thought of the big fire in the bedroom which he had
left. How poor and desolate was this room by contrast!
What a miserable bed he reposed on at night—absolutely
not enough blankets—but Sylvia lay
like a bird in its nest, so warm, so snug! Oh! how
bad she was!
</p>
<p>
“Her mother was never as bad as that,” he muttered
to himself. “She was extravagant, but she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_371'></a>371</span>
was not like Sylvia. She never willingly deceived
me. Sylvia to have a strange and unknown girl—a
stranger—in the house! All my suspicions are
verified. My doubts are certainties. God help me!
I am a miserable old man.”
</p>
<p>
He cowered down, and the icy cold of the room
struck through his bones. He looked at the grate,
and observed that a fire had been laid there.
</p>
<p>
“Sylvia did that,” he said to himself. “The little
minx did not like to feel that she was so warm and
I so cold, so she laid the fire; she thought that I
would indulge myself. I! But am I not suffering
for her? While she lies in the lap of luxury I die of
cold and hunger, and all for her. But I will do it no
longer. I will light the fire; I will have a feast; I
will eat and drink and be merry, and forget that I
had a daughter.”
</p>
<p>
So the unfortunate man, half-mad with bewilderment
and the grief of his recent losses, lit a blazing
fire, and going to his cupboard, took out his brandy
and drank what was left in the bottle. He was
warm now, and his pulse beat more quickly. He
remembered his six bags of gold, and the other six
bags in the garden, and he resolved that if necessary
he would fly without Sylvia. Sylvia could stay behind.
If she managed to have such luxuries without
his aid, she could go on having them; he would
leave her a trifle—yes, a trifle—and save the rest for
himself, and be no longer tortured by an unworthy
and deceitful daughter. But as he thought these
things he became more and more puzzled. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_372'></a>372</span>
Sylvia lying on that bed was undoubtedly his
daughter; but his daughter had spoken to him from
her own room at a reasonable hour—between ten
and eleven o’clock—that same night. How could
there be two Sylvias?
</p>
<p>
“The mystery thickens,” he muttered to himself.
“This is more than I can stand. I will ferret the
thing out—yes, and to the very bottom. Those
trunks in the attic! I suppose they belong to that
ugly child. That voice in Sylvia’s room! Well, of
course it was Sylvia’s voice; but what about the
other Sylvia down-stairs? I must see into this matter
without delay.”
</p>
<p>
He went up-stairs and found himself outside
Sylvia’s door. He turned the handle, but it was
locked. There was a light in the room, doubtless
caused by another fire. He looked through the keyhole;
the door was locked from within, for the key
was in the lock.
</p>
<p>
More and more remarkable! How could Sylvia
lock the door from within if she was not in the
room? Really the matter was enough to daze any
man. Suddenly he made up his mind. It was now
five o’clock in the morning; in a short time the day
would break. Sylvia was an early riser. If Sylvia
or any one else was in that room he would wait on
the threshold to confront that person. Oh, of course
it was Sylvia; she had slipped back again and was
in bed, and thought he would never discover her.
How astonished she would be when she saw him
seated outside her door!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_373'></a>373</span>
</p>
<p>
So Mr. Leeson fetched a broken-down chair from
his own bedroom, placed it softly just outside the
door of the room where Jasper was reposing, and
prepared himself to watch. He was far too excited
to sleep, and the hours dragged slowly on. There
was an old eight-day clock in the hall, and it struck
solemnly hour after hour. Six o’clock—seven
o’clock. Sylvia rose soon after seven. He waited
now impatiently. The days were beginning to
lengthen, and it was light—not full daylight, but
nearly so. He heard a stir in the room.
</p>
<p>
“Ha, ha, Miss Sylvia!” he said to himself, “I
shall catch you, take you by the hand, bring you
down to my parlor, tell you exactly what I think
of——Hullo! she is making a good deal of noise.
How strong she is! How she bounded out of
bed!”
</p>
<p>
He listened impatiently. His heart warmed now
to the work which lay before him. He was, on the
whole, enjoying himself at the thought of discovering
to Sylvia how black he thought her iniquities.
</p>
<p>
“No child of my own any more!” he said to himself.
“‘Poor father,’ indeed! ‘Darling father,
forsooth!’ No, no, Sylvia; acts speak louder than
words, and you were convicted out of your own
mouth, my daughter.”
</p>
<p>
Jasper dressed with despatch. She washed; she
arranged her toilet. She came to the door; she
opened it. Mr. Leeson looked up.
</p>
<p>
Jasper fell back.
</p>
<p>
“Merciful heavens!” cried the woman; and then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_374'></a>374</span>
Mr. Leeson grasped her hand and dragged her out
of the room.
</p>
<p>
“Who are you, woman?” he said. “How dare
you come into my house? What are you doing in
my daughter’s room?”
</p>
<p>
“Ah, Mr. Leeson,” said Jasper quietly, “discovered
at last. Well, sir, and I am not sorry.”
</p>
<p>
“But who are you? What are you? What are
you doing in my daughter’s room?”
</p>
<p>
“Will you come down to the parlor with me, Mr.
Leeson, or shall I explain here?”
</p>
<p>
“You do not stir a step from this place until you
tell me.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I will, sir—I will. I have been living in
this house for the last six weeks. During that time
I have paid Miss Sylvia, and she has had money
enough to keep the breath of life within her. Be
thankful that I came, Mr. Leeson, for you owe me
much, and I owe you nothing. Ah! do you recognize
me now? The gipsy—forsooth!—the gipsy
who gave you a recipe for making the old hen
tender! Ha, ha! I laugh as I thought never to
laugh again when I recall that day.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Leeson stood cold and white, looking full at
Jasper. Suddenly a great dizziness took possession
of him; he stretched out his hand wildly.
</p>
<p>
“There is something wrong with me,” he said.
“I don’t think I am well.”
</p>
<p>
“Poor old gentleman!” said Jasper—“no wonder!”
and her voice became mild. “The shock of
it all, and the confusion! Sakes alive! I am not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_375'></a>375</span>
going to take you into that icy bedroom of yours.
Lean on me. There now, sir. You have not lost a
penny by me; you have saved, on the contrary, and
I have kept your daughter alive, and I have given
you the best food, made out of the tenderest chickens,
out of my own money, mark you—out of my own
money—for weeks and weeks. Come down-stairs,
sir; come and I will get you a bit of breakfast.”
</p>
<p>
“I—cannot—see,” muttered Mr. Leeson again.
</p>
<p>
“Well then, sir, I suppose you can feel. Anyhow,
here is a good, strong right arm. Lean on it—all
your weight if you like. Now then, we will get
down-stairs.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Leeson was past resistance. Jasper pulled
his shaky old hand through her arm, and half-carried,
half-dragged him down to the parlor. There
she put him in a big armchair near the fire, and
was bustling out of the room to get breakfast when
he called her back.
</p>
<p>
“So you really are the woman who had the
recipe for making old hens tender?”
</p>
<p>
“Bless you, Mr. Leeson!—bless you!—yes, I am
the woman.”
</p>
<p>
“You will let me buy it from you?”
</p>
<p>
“Certainly—yes,” replied Jasper, not quite knowing
whether to laugh or to cry. “But I am going
to get you some breakfast now.”
</p>
<p>
“And who is the other girl?”
</p>
<p>
“Does he know about her too?” thought Jasper.
“What can have happened in the night?”
</p>
<p>
“If you mean my dear little Miss Eve, why, no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_376'></a>376</span>
one has a better right to be here, for she belongs to
me and I pay for her—yes, every penny; and, for
the matter of that, she only came last night. But
do not fash yourself now, my good sir; you are past
thought, I take it, and you want a hearty meal.”
</p>
<p>
Jasper bustled away; Mr. Leeson lay back in his
chair. Was the world turning upside down? What
had happened? Oh, if only he could feel well! If
only that giddiness would leave him! What was
the matter? He had been so well and so fierce and
so strong a few hours ago, and now—now even his
anger was slipping away from him. He had felt
quite comforted when he leaned on Jasper’s strong
arm; and when she pushed him into the armchair
and wrapped an old blanket round him, he had
enjoyed it rather than otherwise. Oh! he ought to
be nearly mad with rage; and yet somehow—somehow
he was not.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_377'></a>377</span><a name='chXXX' id='chXXX'></a>CHAPTER XXX.—THE LOADED GUN.</h2>
<p>
Now, it so happened that the fuss and confusion incident
on Evelyn’s departure had penetrated to every
individual in the Castle with the exception of the
Squire; but the Squire had been absent all day on business.
He had been attending a very important meeting
in a neighboring town, and, as his custom was,
told his wife that he should probably not return
until the early morning. When this was the case
the door opening into his private apartments was
left on the latch. He could himself open it with his
latch-key and let himself in, go to bed in a small
room prepared for the purpose, and not disturb the
rest of the family. Lady Frances had many times
during the previous evening lamented her husband’s
absence, but when twelve o’clock came and the police
who had been sent to search for Evelyn could nowhere
find the little girl, and when the different servants
had searched the house in vain, and all that
one woman could think of had been done, Lady
Frances, feeling uncomfortable, but also convinced
in her own mind that Evelyn and Jasper were quite
safe and snug somewhere, resolved to go to bed.
</p>
<p>
“It is no use, Audrey,” she said to her daughter;
“you have cried yourself out of recognition. My
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_378'></a>378</span>
dear child, you must go to bed now, and to sleep.
That naughty, naughty girl is not worth our all
being ill.”
</p>
<p>
“But, oh, mother! what has happened to her?”
</p>
<p>
“She is with Jasper, of course.”
</p>
<p>
“But suppose she is not, mother?”
</p>
<p>
“I do not suppose what is not the case, Audrey.
She is beyond doubt with that pernicious woman,
and as far as I am concerned I wash my hands of
her.”
</p>
<p>
“And—the disgrace to-morrow?” said poor
Audrey.
</p>
<p>
“My darling, you at least shall not be subjected to
it. If I could find Evelyn I would take her myself
to the school, and make her stand up before the
scholars and tell them all that she had done; or if
she refused I would tell for her. But as she is not
here you are not going to be disgraced, my precious.
I shall write a line to Miss Henderson telling her
that the guilty party has flown, and that you are far
too distressed to go to school; and I shall beg her
to take any steps she thinks best. Really and truly
that girl has made the place too hot to live in;
I shall ask your father to take us abroad for the
winter.”
</p>
<p>
“But surely, mother, you will not allow poor little
Evelyn to get quite lost; you will try to find her?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my dear! have I not been trying? Do not
say any more to me about her to-night. I am really
so irritated that I may say something I shall be sorry
for afterwards.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_379'></a>379</span>
</p>
<p>
So Audrey went to bed, and being young, she soon
dropped asleep. Lady Frances, being dead tired,
also slept; and the Squire, who knew nothing of all
the fuss and trouble, came in at an early hour in the
morning.
</p>
<p>
He lay down to sleep, and awoke after a short
slumber. He then got up, dressed, and went into
his grounds.
</p>
<p>
Lady Frances and Audrey were at breakfast—Lady
Frances very pale, and Audrey with traces of
her violent weeping the night before still on her
face—when a servant burst in great terror and excitement
into the room.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, your ladyship,” he exclaimed, “the Squire
is lying in the copse badly shot with his own gun!
One of the grooms is with him, and Jones has gone
for the doctor, and I came at once to tell your
ladyship.”
</p>
<p>
Poor Lady Frances in her agony scarcely knew
what she was doing. Audrey asked a frenzied question,
and soon the two were bending over the stricken
man. The Squire was shot badly in the side. A
new fowling-piece lay a yard or two away.
</p>
<p>
“How did it happen?” said Lady Frances.
“What can it mean?”
</p>
<p>
Audrey knelt by her father, took his icy-cold hand
in hers, and held it to her lips. Was he dead?
</p>
<p>
As he lay there the young girl for the first time
in all her life learned how passionately, how dearly
she loved him. What would life be without him?
In some ways she was nearer to her mother than to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_380'></a>380</span>
her father, but just now, as he lay looking like
death itself, he was all in all to her.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, when will the doctor come?” said Lady
Frances, raising her haggard face. “Oh, he is
bleeding to death—he is bleeding to death!”
</p>
<p>
With all her knowledge—and it was considerable—with
all her common-sense, on which she prided
herself, Lady Frances knew very little about illness
and still less about wounds. She did not know how
to stop the bleeding, and it was well the doctor, a
bright-faced young man from the neighboring village,
was soon on the spot. He examined the
wounds, looked at the gun, did what was necessary
to stop the immediate bleeding, and soon the Squire
was carried on a hastily improvised litter back to
his stately home.
</p>
<p>
An hour ago in the prime of life, in the prime
of strength; now, for all his terrified wife and
daughter could know, he was already in the shadow
of death.
</p>
<p>
“Will he die, doctor?” asked Audrey.
</p>
<p>
The young doctor looked at her pitifully.
</p>
<p>
“I cannot tell,” he replied; “it depends upon
how far the bullet has penetrated. It is unfortunate
that he should have been shot in such a dangerous
part of the body. How did it happen?”
</p>
<p>
A groom now came up and told a hasty tale.
</p>
<p>
“The Squire called me this morning,” he said,
“and told me to go into his study and bring him
out his new fowling-piece, which had been sent from
London a few days ago. I brought it just as it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_381'></a>381</span>
was. He took it without noticing it much. I was
about to turn round and say to him, ‘It is at full
cock—perhaps you don’t know, sir,’ but I thought,
of course, he had loaded it and prepared it himself;
and the next minute he was climbing a hedge. I
heard a report, and he was lying just where you
found him.”
</p>
<p>
The question which immediately followed this
recital was, “Who had loaded the gun?”
</p>
<p>
Another doctor was summoned, and another telegraphed
for from London, and great was the agitation
and misery. By and by Audrey found herself
alone. She could scarcely understand her own
sensations. In the first place, she was absolutely
useless. Her mother was absorbed in the sickroom;
the servants were all occupied—even Read was engaged
as temporary nurse until a trained one should
arrive. Poor Audrey put on her hat and went out.
</p>
<p>
“If only my dear Miss Sinclair were here!” she
thought. “Even if Evelyn were here it would be
better than nothing. Oh, no wonder we quite forget
Evelyn in a time of anguish like the present!”
</p>
<p>
Then a fearful thought stabbed her to the heart.
</p>
<p>
“If anything happens——” She could not get her
lips to form the word she really thought of. Once
again she used the conventional phrase:
</p>
<p>
“If anything happens, Evelyn will be mistress
here.”
</p>
<p>
She looked wildly around her.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! I must find some one; I must speak to some
one,” she thought. “I will go to Sylvia; it is no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_382'></a>382</span>
great distance to The Priory. I will go over there
at once.”
</p>
<p>
She walked quickly. She was glad of the exercise—of
any excuse to keep moving. She soon
reached The Priory, and was just about to put her
hand on the latch to open the big gates when a girl
appeared on the other side—a girl with a white face,
somewhat sullen in outline, with big brown eyes,
and a quantity of fair hair falling over her shoulders.
Even in the midst of her agitation Audrey gave a
gasp.
</p>
<p>
“Evelyn!” she said.
</p>
<p>
“I am not going with you,” said Evelyn. She
backed away, and a look of apprehension crossed
her face. “Why have you come here? You never
come to The Priory. What are you doing here?
Go away. You need not think you will have anything
to do with me in the future. I know it is all
up with me. I suppose you have come from the
school to—to torture me!”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t, Evelyn—don’t,” said Audrey. “Oh, the
misery you caused us last night! But that is nothing
to what has happened now. Listen, and forget
yourself for a minute.”
</p>
<p>
Poor Audrey tottered forward; her composure
gave way. The next moment her head was on her
cousin’s shoulder; she was sobbing as if her heart
would break.
</p>
<p>
“Why, how strange you are!” said Evelyn, distressed
and slightly softened, but, all the same, much
annoyed at what she believed would frustrate all her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_383'></a>383</span>
plans. For things had been going so well! The
poor, silly old man who lived at The Priory was too
ill to take any notice. She and Sylvia could do
as they pleased. Jasper was Mr. Leeson’s nurse.
Mr. Leeson was delirious and talking wild nonsense.
Evelyn was in a scene of excitement; she was petted
and made much of. Why did Audrey come to remind
her of that world from which she had fled?
</p>
<p>
“I suppose it was rather bad this morning at
school,” she said. “I can imagine what a fuss they
kicked up—what a shindy—all about nothing! But
there! yes, of course, I do not mind saying now that
I did do it. I was sorry afterwards; I would not
have done it if I had known—if I had guessed that
everybody would be so terribly miserable. But you
do not suppose—you do not suppose, Audrey, that
I, who am to be the owner of Castle Wynford some
day——”
</p>
<p>
But at these words Audrey gave a piercing cry:
</p>
<p>
“Some day! Oh, Evelyn, it may be to-day!”
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?” said Evelyn, her face
turning very white. She pushed Audrey, who was
a good deal taller than her cousin, away and looked
up at her. Audrey had now ceased crying; she
wiped the tears from her cheeks.
</p>
<p>
“I must tell you,” she said. “It is my father.
He shot himself by accident this morning. His new
gun from London was loaded. I suppose he did
not know it; anyhow, he knocked the gun against
something and it went off, and—he is at death’s
door.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_384'></a>384</span>
</p>
<p>
“What—do—you say?” asked Evelyn.
</p>
<p>
A complete change had come over her. Her eyes
looked dim and yet wild. She took Audrey by the
arm and shook her.
</p>
<p>
“The gun from London loaded, and it went off,
and—— Is he hurt much—much? Speak, Audrey—speak!”
</p>
<p>
She took her cousin now and shook her frantically.
</p>
<p>
“Speak!” she said. “You are driving me mad!”
</p>
<p>
“What is the matter with you, Evelyn?”
</p>
<p>
“Speak! Is he—hurt—much?”
</p>
<p>
“Much!” said Audrey. “The doctor does not
know whether he will ever recover. Oh, what have
I done to you?”
</p>
<p>
“Nothing,” said Evelyn. “Get out of my way.”
</p>
<p>
Like a wild creature she darted from her cousin,
and, fast and fleet as her feet could carry her, rushed
back to Castle Wynford.
</p>
<p>
It took a good deal to touch a heart like Evelyn’s,
but it was touched at last; nay, more, it was
wounded; it was struck with a blow so deep, so sudden,
so appalling, that the bewildered child reeled
as she ran. Her eyes grew dark with emotion. She
was past tears; she was almost past words. By
and by, breathless, scared, bewildered, carried completely
out of herself, she entered the Castle. There
was no one about, but a doctor’s brougham stood
before the principal entrance. Evelyn looked
wildly around her. She knew her uncle’s room.
She ran up-stairs. Without waiting for any one to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_385'></a>385</span>
answer, she burst open the door. The room was
empty.
</p>
<p>
“He must be very badly hurt,” she whispered to
herself. “He must be in his little room on the
ground floor.”
</p>
<p>
She went down-stairs again. She ran down the
corridor where often, when in her best moments, she
had gone to talk to him, to pet him, to love him.
She entered the sitting-room where the gun had
been. A great shudder passed through her frame
as she saw the empty case. She went straight
through the sitting-room, and, unannounced, undesired,
unwished-for, entered the bedroom.
</p>
<p>
There were doctors round the bed; Lady Frances
was standing by the head; and a man was lying
there, very still and quiet, with his eyes shut and a
peaceful smile on his face.
</p>
<p>
“He is dead,” thought Evelyn—“he is dead!”
She gave a gasp, and the next instant lay in an
unconscious heap on the floor.
</p>
<p>
When the unhappy child came to herself she was
lying on a sofa in the sitting-room. A doctor was
bending over her.
</p>
<p>
“Now you are better,” he said. “You did very
wrong to come into the bedroom. You must lie
still; you must not make a fuss.”
</p>
<p>
“I remember everything,” said Evelyn. “It was
I who did it. It was I who killed him. Don’t—don’t
keep me. I must sit up; I must speak. Will
he die? If he dies I shall have killed him. You
understand, I—I shall have done it!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_386'></a>386</span>
</p>
<p>
The doctor looked disturbed and distressed. Was
this poor little girl mad? Who was she? He had
heard of an heiress from Australia: could this be the
child? But surely her brain had given way under
the extreme pressure and shock!
</p>
<p>
“Lie still, my dear,” he said gently; and he put
his hand on the excited child’s forehead.
</p>
<p>
“I will be good if you will help me,” said the girl;
and she took both his hands in hers and raised her
burning eyes to his face.
</p>
<p>
“I will do anything in my power.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you see what it means to me?—and I must
be with him. Is he dead?”
</p>
<p>
“No, no.”
</p>
<p>
“Is he in great danger?”
</p>
<p>
“I will tell you, if you are good, after the doctor
from London comes.”
</p>
<p>
“But I did it.”
</p>
<p>
“Excuse me, miss—I do not know your name—you
are talking nonsense.”
</p>
<p>
“Let me explain. Oh! there never was such a
wicked girl; I do not mind saying it now. I loaded
the gun just to show him that I could shoot a bird
on the wing, and—and I forgot all about it; I forgot
I had left the gun loaded. Oh, how can I ever
forgive myself?”
</p>
<p>
The doctor asked her a few more questions. He
tried to soothe her. He then said if she would stay
where she was he would bring her the very first
news from the London doctor. The case was not
hopeless, he assured her; but there was danger—grave
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_387'></a>387</span>
danger—and any shock would bring on hemorrhage,
and hemorrhage would be fatal.
</p>
<p>
The little girl listened to him, and as she listened
a new and wonderful strength was given to her. At
that instant Evelyn Wynford ceased to be a child.
She was never a child any more. The suffering and
the shock had been too mighty; they had done for
her what perhaps nothing else could ever do—they
had awakened her slumbering soul.
</p>
<p>
How she lived through the remainder of that day
she could never tell to any one. No one saw her in
the Squire’s sitting-room. No one wanted the
room; no one went near it. Audrey was back again
at the Castle, comforting her mother and trying to
help her. When she spoke of Evelyn, Lady Frances
shuddered.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t mention her,” she said. “She had the
impertinence to rush into the room; but she also had
the grace to——”
</p>
<p>
“What, mother?”
</p>
<p>
“She was really fond of her uncle, Audrey; I
always said so. She fainted—poor, miserable girl—when
she saw the state he was in.”
</p>
<p>
But Lady Frances did not know of Evelyn’s confession
to the young doctor; nor did Dr. Watson
tell any one.
</p>
<p>
It was late and the day had passed into night
when the doctor came in and sat down by Evelyn’s
side.
</p>
<p>
“Now,” he said, “you have been good, and have
kept your word, and have obliterated yourself.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_388'></a>388</span>
</p>
<p>
She did not ask him the meaning of the word,
although she did not understand it. She looked at
him with the most pathetic face he had ever
seen.
</p>
<p>
“Speak,” she said. “Will he live?”
</p>
<p>
“Dr. Harland thinks so, and he is the very best
authority in the world. He hopes in a day or two
to remove the pellets which have done the mischief.
The danger, as I have already told you, lies in renewed
hemorrhage; but that I hope we can prevent.
Now, are you going to be a very good girl?”
</p>
<p>
“What can I do?” asked Evelyn. “Can I go to
him and stay with him?”
</p>
<p>
“I wonder,” said the doctor—“and yet,” he
added, “I scarcely like to propose it. There is a
nurse there; your aunt is worn out. I will see
what I can do.”
</p>
<p>
“If I could do that it would save me,” said
Evelyn. “There never, never has been quite such
a naughty girl; and I—I did it—oh! not meaning
to hurt him, but I did it. Oh! it would save me if
I might sit by him.”
</p>
<p>
“I will see,” said the doctor.
</p>
<p>
He felt strangely interested in this queer, erratic,
lost-looking child. He went back again to the sickroom.
The Squire was conscious. He was lying in
comparative ease on his bed; a trained nurse was
within reach.
</p>
<p>
“Nurse,” said the doctor.
</p>
<p>
The woman went with him across the room.
</p>
<p>
“I am going to stay here to-night.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_389'></a>389</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir; I am glad to hear it.”
</p>
<p>
“It is quite understood that Lady Frances is to
have her night’s rest?”
</p>
<p>
“Her ladyship is quite worn out, sir. She has
gone away to her room. She will rest until two in
the morning, when she will come down-stairs and
help me to watch by the patient.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I will sit with him until two o’clock,” said
the doctor. “At two o’clock I will lie down in the
Squire’s sitting-room, where I can be within call.
Now, I want to make a request.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“I am particularly anxious that a little girl who
is in very great trouble, but who has learnt self-control,
should come in and sit in the armchair by the
Squire’s side. She will not speak, but will sit there.
Is there any objection?”
</p>
<p>
“Is it the child, sir, who fainted when she came
into the room to-day?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; she was almost mad, poor little soul; but
I think she is all right now, and she has learnt her
lesson. Nurse, can you manage it?”
</p>
<p>
“It must be as you please, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I will risk it,” said the doctor.
</p>
<p>
He went back to Evelyn, and said a few words to
her.
</p>
<p>
“You must wash your face,” he said, “and tidy
yourself; and you must have a good meal.”
</p>
<p>
Evelyn shook her head.
</p>
<p>
“If you do not do exactly what I tell you I cannot
help you.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_390'></a>390</span>
</p>
<p>
“Very well; I will eat and eat until you tell me
to stop,” she answered.
</p>
<p>
“Go, and be quick, then,” said the doctor, “for
we are arranging things for the night.”
</p>
<p>
So Evelyn went, and returned in a few minutes;
then the doctor took her hand and led her into the
sickroom, and she sat by the side of the patient.
</p>
<p>
The room was very still—not a sound, not a movement.
The sick man slept; Evelyn, with her eyes
wide open, sat, not daring to move a finger.
</p>
<p>
What she thought of her past life during that
time no one knows; but that soul within her was
coming more and more to the surface. It was a
strong soul, although it had been so long asleep, and
already new desires, unselfish and beautiful, were
awakening in the child. Between twelve and one
that night the Squire opened his eyes and saw a
little girl, with a white face and eyes big and dark,
seated close to him.
</p>
<p>
He smiled, and his hand just went out a quarter
of an inch to Evelyn. She saw the movement, and
immediately her own small fingers clasped his. She
bent down and kissed his hand.
</p>
<p>
“Uncle Edward, do not speak,” she said. “It
was I who loaded the gun. You must get well,
Uncle Edward, or I shall die.”
</p>
<p>
He did not answer in any words, but his eyes
smiled at her; and the next moment she had sunk
back in her chair, relieved to her heart’s core. Her
eyes closed; she slept.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_391'></a>391</span><a name='chXXXI' id='chXXXI'></a>CHAPTER XXXI.—FOR UNCLE EDWARD’S SAKE.</h2>
<p>
The Squire was a shade better the next morning;
but Mr. Leeson, not two miles away, lay at the point
of death. Fever had claimed him for its prey, and
he continued to be wildly delirious, and did not
know in the least what he was doing. Thus two
men, each unknown to the other, but who widely
influenced the characters of this story, lay within
the Great Shadow.
</p>
<p>
Evelyn Wynford continued to efface herself. This
was the first time in her whole life she had ever done
so; but when Lady Frances appeared, punctual to
the hour, to take her place at her husband’s side, the
little girl glided from the room.
</p>
<p>
It was early on the following morning, when the
mistress of the Castle was standing for a few bewildered
moments in her sitting-room, her hand
pressed to her forehead, her eyes looking across the
landscape, tears dimming their brightness, that a
child rushed into her presence.
</p>
<p>
“Go away, Evelyn,” she said. “I cannot speak
to you.”
</p>
<p>
“Tell me one thing,” said Evelyn; “is he better?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_392'></a>392</span>
</p>
<p>
“Is he out of danger?”
</p>
<p>
“The doctors think so.”
</p>
<p>
“Then, Aunt Frances, I can thank God; and what
is more, I—even I, who am such an awfully naughty
girl—can love God.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t like cant,” said Lady Frances; and she
turned away with a scornful expression on her lips.
</p>
<p>
Evelyn sprang to her, clutched both her hands, and
said excitedly:
</p>
<p>
“Listen; you must. I have something to say.
It was I who did it!”
</p>
<p>
“You, Evelyn—you!”
</p>
<p>
Lady Frances pushed the child from her, and
moved a step away. There was such a look of
horror on her face that Evelyn at another moment
must have recoiled from it; but nothing could daunt
her now in this hour of intense repentance.
</p>
<p>
“I did it,” she repeated—“oh, not meaning to do
it! I will tell you; you must listen. Oh, I have been
so—so wicked, so—so naughty, so stubborn, so selfish!
I see myself at last; and there never, never
was such a horrid girl before. Aunt Frances, you
shall listen. I loaded the gun, for I meant to go out
and shoot some birds on the wing. Uncle Edward
doubted that I could do it, and I wanted to prove to
him that I could; but I was prevented from going,
and I forgot about the gun; and the night before
last I ran away. I ran to Jasper. When you locked
me up in my room I got out of my sitting-room
window.”
</p>
<p>
“I know all that,” said Lady Frances.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_393'></a>393</span>
</p>
<p>
“I went to Jasper, and Jasper took me to The
Priory—to Sylvia’s home. Jasper has been staying
in the house with Sylvia for a long time, and I went
to Sylvia and to Jasper, and I hid there. Audrey
came yesterday morning and told me what had
happened; and, oh! I thought my heart would
break. But Uncle Edward has forgiven me.”
</p>
<p>
“What! Have you dared to see him?”
</p>
<p>
“The doctor gave me leave. I stayed with him
half last night, until you came at two o’clock; and I
told Uncle Edward, and he smiled. He has forgiven
me. Oh! I love him better than any one in all the
world; I could just die for him. And, Aunt Frances,
I did tear the book, and I did behave shockingly
at school; and I will go straight to Miss Henderson
and tell her, and I will do everything—everything you
wish, if only you will let me stay in the house with
Uncle Edward. For somehow—somehow,” continued
Evelyn in a whisper, her voice turning husky
and almost dying away, “I think Uncle Edward has
made religion and <em>God</em> possible to me.”
</p>
<p>
As Evelyn said the last words she staggered
against the table, deadly white. She put one hand
on a chair to steady herself, and looked up with
pathetic eyes at her aunt.
</p>
<p>
What was there in that scared, bewildered, and
yet resolved face which for the first time since she
had seen it touched Lady Frances?
</p>
<p>
“Evelyn,” she said, “you ask me to forgive you.
What you have said has shocked me very much, but
your manner of saying it has opened my eyes. If
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_394'></a>394</span>
you have done wrong, doubtless I am not blameless
I never showed you——”
</p>
<p>
“Neither sympathy nor understanding,” said
Evelyn. “I might have been different had you been
different. But please—please, do anything with me
now—anything—only let me stay for Uncle Edward’s
sake.”
</p>
<p>
Lady Frances sat down.
</p>
<p>
“I am a mother,” she said, “and I am not without
feeling, and not without sympathy, and not without
understanding.”
</p>
<p>
And then she opened her arms. Evelyn gave a
bewildered cry; the next moment she was folded in
their embrace.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, can I believe it?” she sobbed.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
Thus Evelyn Wynford found the Better Part, and
from that moment, although she had struggles and
difficulties and trials, she was in the very best sense
of the word a new creature; for Love had sought
her out, and Love can lead one by steep ascents on
to the peaks of self-denial, unselfishness, truth, and
honor.
</p>
<p>
Sylvia’s father, after a mighty struggle with
severe illness, came back again slowly, sadly to the
shores of life; and Sylvia managed him and loved
him, and he declared that never to his dying day
could he do without Jasper, who had nursed him
through his terrible illness. The instincts of a
miser had almost died out during his illness, and he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_395'></a>395</span>
was willing that Sylvia should spend as much money
as was necessary to secure good food and the comforts
of life.
</p>
<p>
The Squire got slowly better, and presently quite
well; and when another New Year dawned upon the
world, and once again the Wynfords of Wynford
Castle kept open house, Sylvia was there, and also
Mr. Leeson; and all the characters in this story met
under the same roof. Evelyn clung fast to her
uncle’s hand. Audrey glanced at her cousin, and
then she looked at Sylvia, and said in a low voice:
</p>

“Never was any one so changed; and, do you
know, since the accident she has never once spoken
of being the heiress. I believe if any thing happened
to father Evelyn would die.”

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
